There is no uplifting way for a truly disadvantaged person to endure real-life hardship and overcome real-world hurdles to become an indie rock darling, just like there is no uplifting way for a poor person to work hard and scrimp and save to buy a designer handbag. If paying for that handbag hurts you financially, you should just not do it. And if the reality of what building up a grassroots following necessarily entails poses undue burdens on you, you should just not do that either. Because in both cases, we as a society have inflated its value to be far greater than its actual worth. And we know this, but as long as the only people paying its high cost are the ones who can afford it, then we're happy to maintain the charade. But we're not jerks. The minute a truly disadvantaged person starts wondering whether to buy in, we know the charade has to end.

You can still make the kind of music that indie rock kids love by not doing things the indie rock way. By not building up a grassroots following, and instead cultivating your talents, creating exceptionally clever and interesting works. You'll do just fine, and everyone knows this, even indie rock kids. So if the conventional indie rock path poses an unnecessary burden on someone who's truly destitute, truly disabled or disadvantaged, all of us would immediately tell them, you don't have to be indie rock. You just have to be good. One has nothing to do with the other.

The thing that indie rock cares about, the thing that distinguishes indie rock from just plain rock, is a luxury good. We don't want to see artists enduring real-life hardships, making real-world sacrifices, to build up indie cred. We would find such stories depressing, not uplifting. Building up a grassroots following from the ground up means playing weeknight shows in neighbouring towns hours away, where no one's heard of you and there's no guarantee you'll even have an audience. Because deep down, we know that it has no intrinsic value. Society gives it its value.

Indie rock is like the popular kids who can make something uncool cool. The less popular kids can tap into that coolness, but they have no power to make it cool themselves.

An everyman is a lone individual who, by sheer virtue of their modest circumstances, can represent everyone else. They are necessarily a member of the privileged, dominant group. Everyman cultures in the 21st century are increasingly going to suck.

Donald Trump forced white liberals to finally admit what indie rock has required them all these years to never admit.

Indie rock is like Donald Trump, in that all the dots you need to connect to draw a picture of privileged mediocrity are already there.

Women and minorities are reluctant to advocate for themselves in the public arena, because a lifetime lived in their shoes has taught them that it's not worth their time and energy to navigate through that minefield of unconscious bias. The smart path for them is to advocate for themselves in the private arena, in intimate, face-to-face settings where they have the most control to counter the effects of unconscious bias, to limit its damage. And slowly build up partnerships and alliances, and then have these partners and allies advocate for them in the public arena.

The whole point of indie rock is to compete for the most participation trophies. Alternate sports league?

Indie rock, by its nature, must believe in natural talent. That's the only way it makes sense to celebrate the reality it forces upon its artists, to have to sacrifice time that would otherwise be spent on artistic tasks to do administrative tasks.

Must renounce Radiohead. It is needlessly risky for minorities to participate in a subculture founded by whites, in which the rules are both arbitrary/absurd and inconsistently enforced. Unlike say, sports.

Less privileged members of the most privileged group see interdependence as a path accessible only to the privileged, while the only path accessible to them is independence. And they assume everyone below them feels the same. But members of the less privileged groups see the opposite. Society wasn't meant for them to do things on their own.

Cult of personality - are bands good because they're indie, or indie because they're good? No answer, because we're just doing what the founders did.

The process - you have to enjoy the process, most genres are agnostic to the process.

The Worst Two Decades of Rock

This might seem like a moot point, because what other two decades could it be? I might as well have said that this is the worst century of classical music.
So let me proclaim my sincere belief that if we wanted to, we could beat the 70s. Stravinsky.

Oceans overfished, fewer big fish, dwindling rain forest. No one says, "Damn Millennials." I'm not criticising the present generation's lack of vision. I'm criticising the present generation's lack of stewardship. That is, my generation, Generation X. And there is no greater reflection of Generation X's values than indie rock.

Bizarro world argument: empowering middleman, bypass artist

Asthmatic Kitty, demo tapes. There is no such thing as being overridingly good in your recorded output. What they are promising is that an inconsequential concern is superior to the most consequential.

The best albums lead the way for live performance. This isn't hypothetical, it's already reflected in our "best of" lists.

Demo tape recordings transcend social boundaries (indie rock placed a bet that performances, not recordings, are what defines music. world that's becoming increasingly comfortable with the fact that recordings, not performances)

Virality, stories of technology abetting the dissemination of art, rather than the creation of it, are massively uninteresting to us. Beethoven lithography, pianoforte

Comparison to hip hop. Hip hop doesn't question that competitive virtues are necessary, only how they can be manifested. Indie rock's whole conceit is to elevate non-competitive virtues above competitive ones.

Underdog culture: Underdog culture is just like any other system that favours some over others. But it's the least likely to recognise the de facto underdogs of its time. An underdog culture can never belatedly pivot to the de facto underdog.

Altruistic audiences, Contrived narratives, alternate facts, Trump, assume that because you're willing to suspend your understanding of reality for the sake of the fun narrative, that everyone else is.

Startups, knowledgeable curators with their ears to the ground vs. Zappa's cigar chomping old guys. At best, you understand trends, not innovations.

Millennial whoops
Not blaming Millennials for their lack of vision, I do blame them for their lack of spine. Pavement. Dweck. These are your values, Millennials, and you've been applying them in other industries, and other mediums, with amazing results. Why on earth haven't you applied them to your rock music? Anti-science, alternative facts. Malkmus is a genius for the same reason that Trump is, because his followers were already determined to root for him from the get-go, so everything he does, by default, is genius.

Bob Dylan, as a Jew, many in the 70s might not have seen him as a card-carrying member of the shadowy ruling class, but he still wouldn't have been most people's choice of an outsider.

Make Rock Music Great Again - white working class sees world as becoming more ruthless so they voted for Trump, but it's actually more competitve, which is to say, more fair. Protectionism. What if the satisfaction that conservatives get upon seeing Trump's cabinet is the same one that indie rock fans get upon seeing the pantheon, with a few token minorities and women? What if everyone else recognises that it leads to you choosing things that are inferior and worse?

White male supremacy: three phases. the last one where our assumptions about white men cause us to choose those who are transparently less qualified. Donald Trump perfect example. But what if the same could be said about white male *cultural* supremacy? What if Stephen Malkmus, whom you love being he redefines what it means to be qualified (just like Trump), is just transparently less qualified to everyone else?

White kids love Stephen Malkmus for the same reason that the white working class loves Donald Trump. Both empower the common man by redefining what it means to be qualified. But what if, to everyone else, this is just one more example of an underqualified white man getting the job because of his privilege? Anti-establishment.

Hip hop keeps the conventional virtues, like talent and creativity, and only reimagines channels them in different ways. Indie rock is about rethinking whether the conventional virtues should even be valued to begin with. But what if no one actively chose which virtues are valued by convention? What if they are what they are because they are optimally competitive? To rethink the conventional virtues, then, is necessarily to replace competitive virtues with non-competitive virtues. Pluck, spirit, courage, authenticity, and so forth.

And at some point, non-conventional virtues cannot be used to determine who gets it. They can only be used to justify why the people who get it deserve it.

Argument:
Any culture or institution that's genuinely interested in tackling discrimination will begin by returning to basics, and deciding what is important, what defines them, and then putting everything else on the negotiating table. Because if something that is unimportant turns out to be inadvertently causing discrimination, then it can be scrapped, at no cost. In other words, to go after the low-hanging fruit, the things that can yield the greatest results for the least effort. Indie rock can't even begin to do this much, because it's defined in its entirety by things that are unimportant. There is nothing that is unique to indie rock that is so important that it can't be compromised in any genuine effort to tackle discrimination.

Indie rock is racist because it discriminates against minorities, which is the textbook definition of racism. But indie rock discriminates against minorities not because it's against minorities, but because it discriminates. Indie rock's sole purpose is to pass the value judgment that the independent path of building a following from the bottom up is superior to the interdependent path of building one from the top down. Yet no one actually believes this. Which means indie rock's sole purpose is to favour some artists over others based on an arbitrary value judgment, which is the textbook definition of discrimination. So indie rock is a subculture that a) was founded overwhelmingly by able-bodied white men, b) disproportionately favours able-bodied white men, and c) actively practises discrimination.
