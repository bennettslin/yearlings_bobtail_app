The Worst Two Decades of Rock

On some level this is a trivial argument, because what other two decades could it be?

Oceans overfished, fewer big fish. Criticising the last generation's lack of stewardship, not the present generation's lack of vision.

Bizarro world argument: empowering middleman, bypass artist

Demo tape recordings transcend social boundaries (indie rock placed a bet that performances, not recordings, are what defines music. world that's becoming increasingly comfortable with the fact that recordings, not performances)

Virality, stories of technology aiding the dissemination of art are massively uninteresting to us

Underdog culture: Underdog culture is just like any other system that favours some over others. But it's the least likely to recognise the de facto underdogs of its time.


Altruistic audiences

Contrived narratives

Bob Dylan, as a Jew, many in the 70s might not have seen him as a card-carrying member of the shadowy ruling class, but he still wouldn't have been most people's choice of an outsider.

Make Rock Music Great Again - white working class sees world as becoming more ruthless so they voted for Trump, but it's actually more competitve, which is to say, more fair. Protectionism. What if the satisfaction that conservatives get upon seeing Trump's cabinet is the same one that indie rock fans get upon seeing the pantheon, with a few token minorities and women? What if everyone else recognises that it leads to you choosing things that are inferior and worse?

White male supremacy: three phases. the last one where our assumptions about white men cause us to choose those who are transparently less qualified. Donald Trump perfect example. But what if the same could be said about white male *cultural* supremacy? What if Stephen Malkmus, whom you love being he redefines what it means to be qualified (just like Trump), is just transparently less qualified to everyone else?

White kids love Stephen Malkmus for the same reason that the white working class loves Donald Trump. Both empower the common man by redefining what it means to be qualified. But what if, to everyone else, this is just one more example of an underqualified white man getting the job because of his privilege? Anti-establishment.


Hip hop keeps the conventional virtues, like talent and creativity, and only reimagines channels them in different ways. Indie rock is about rethinking whether the conventional virtues should even be valued to begin with. But what if no one actively chose which virtues are valued by convention? What if they are what they are because they are optimally competitive? To rethink the conventional virtues, then, is necessarily to replace competitive virtues with non-competitive virtues. Pluck, spirit, courage, authenticity, and so forth.


And at some point, non-conventional virtues cannot be used to determine who gets it. They can only be used to justify why the people who get it deserve it.
