The Worst Two Decades of Rock

On some level this is a trivial argument, because what other two decades could it be?

Oceans overfished, fewer big fish. Criticising the last generation's lack of stewardship, not the present generation's lack of vision.

Bizarro world argument: empowering middleman, bypass artist

Demo tape recordings transcend social boundaries (indie rock placed a bet that performances, not recordings, are what defines music. world that's becoming increasingly comfortable with the fact that recordings, not performances)

Virality, stories of technology aiding the dissemination of art are massively uninteresting to us

Underdog culture
Altruistic audiences

Contrived narratives

Bob Dylan, as a Jew, many in the 70s might not have seen him as a card-carrying member of the shadowy ruling class, but he still wouldn't have been most people's choice of an outsider.

White male cultural supremacy: future generations will see three phases. we are in the last one, the one where it is actively detrimental

Hip hop keeps the conventional virtues, like talent and creativity, and only reimagines channels them in different ways. Indie rock is about rethinking whether the conventional virtues should even be valued to begin with. But what if no one actively chose which virtues are valued by convention? What if they are what they are because they are optimally competitive? To rethink the conventional virtues, then, is necessarily to replace competitive virtues with non-competitive virtues. Pluck, spirit, courage, authenticity, and so forth.


And at some point, non-conventional virtues cannot be used to determine who gets it. They can only be used to justify why the people who get it deserve it.
