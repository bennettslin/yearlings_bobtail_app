<h1>Odin</h1>
<p>
    Mr. Odin died today.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Lights off, from your hiding place of retreat emerged.<br>
    This fridge's gallery in web's wake was strewn,<br>
    silent poll of colours overused. <br>
    This latest piece you drew with crayons least whittled...<br>
    <i>By lot, once more trifling tref must reseed the earth.</i><br>
    <i>Indifferent galaxies instead stay unmoved;</i><br>
    <i>sigh and pull the covers over you.</i><br>
    <i>In safest sleep, you ruminate on these riddles...</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    The house settled in sheets, you swing the iron screen.<br>
    By the alabaster balustrade,<br>
    baby steps inch towards crevice rays.<br>
    <i>But how dreadful indeed, do sweet dream's ichors seem!</i><br>
    <i>Like a salamander shall await</i><br>
    <i>trading breath's bliss for present bane.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    Then down stygian stairs,<br>
    through sickle-lit oriental streets.<br>
    Raccoons rummage round some rubbish bags,<br>
    till a rickshaw hiccoughs from grating cracks.<br>
    You seek the dunes once deemed a haven<br>
    that was safe for a heathen...<br>
    <i>And how stingy and scarce</i><br>
    <i>proves shibboleth for these gentle means!</i><br>
    <i>As you plummet down from couplets past;</i><br>
    <i>still, but missed bat mitzvahs come racing back.</i><br>
    <i>To dreams of whom does each one cave in</i><br>
    <i>as a slave for the seasons?</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    And if flutters with the fairest<br>
    were just sins simply dreamt,<br>
    could some bottled butterfly dream your whims instead?<br>
    What's more, if all you live for still die at the end--<br>
    like Odin's ashes back from the Society,<br>
    which filled a chasm dug up underneath--<br>
    can that which kills a cat spare his home if spread?<br>
    <i>And if summer trips to Paris</i><br>
    <i>weren't just myths between friends,</i><br>
    <i>would the rondel of her eye be stored in this neck?</i><br>
    <i>But cored gifts fall to discord till lives acquiesce,</i><br>
    <i>by opened latches that come undone by undine--</i><br>
    <i>which spilled a basket among other things--</i><br>
    <i>a casket tilted back where its hopeless rests.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    You researched a gleam<br>
    to be a guard's whistle at your feet,<br>
    and brought your raft behind the yellow-taped grills<br>
    to stand onshore keen to drift if shark swarms withheld.<br>
    <i>Your seizures of spleen,</i><br>
    <i>you see the jarred sibyl had foreseen</i><br>
    <i>as not for wrapping by a cellophane sylph,</i><br>
    <i>who cannot warm he who didn't impart warmth himself.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    Buoy bobs through sea serpents,<br>
    shivering for shivs unsheathed.<br>
    As roller coasters of waves comfort sighs,<br>
    you frame silhouettes of torn rides<br>
    in your dim, lingering gaze,<br>
    a victim of erosion.<br>
    <i>Coin toss to be hers from</i><br>
    <i>shivaree towards shivah seat</i><br>
    <i>has pulled your floater away from your sight.</i><br>
    <i>You chase till dew sheds from your eyes</i><br>
    <i>with your beleaguered remains,</i><br>
    <i>amidst dustbunnies frozen.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    Should you hide, or could you fight,<br>
    when your day to die has come?<br>
    <i>Can a holed up hostage<br>
    pray for soulless solace and just play dumb?</i><br>
    But in time, wouldn't you find life is simply much too long?<br>
</p>
<p>
    But for a foetus force-fed, born preaborted,<br>
    your ouija board said, "Son, just hum along."<br>
    <i>Yet your defeat of tortoise, forced lead unthwarted,</i><br>
    <i>sworn feat aforesaid, doesn't come anon.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    Though, no slave parts these seas,<br>
    then returns them as a buffer zone.<br>
    The sudsy ocean shapes its padded bed,<br>
    which hitherto snubbed and spurned a wreck,<br>
    while mermaids smile past a guileless garden gnome...<br>
    <i>Though, no grey starling's beak</i><br>
    <i>can reach urchins smashed from undertows.</i><br>
    <i>But suddenly Odin's day is at its end;</i><br>
    <i>his litter to dust and earth was swept,</i><br>
    <i>while Thursday's child has a mile less far to go...</i><br>
</p>
