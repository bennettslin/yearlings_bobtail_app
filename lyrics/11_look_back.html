<h1>Look Back in Anger</h1>
<p>
    Scrambled past this hell, where flagboy last fell,<br>
    dragging aglets held by the bastard's boot, <br>
    as the Van Nuys belles lunched soundless through the noon. <br>
    Now your sapling cut says you've past ring one, <br>
    yet--if adding up--then for more you'd vie. <br>
    From the valley of death you rode, so on spite you thrive. <br>
</p>
<p>
    Feeble feeder fish allowed to grow; <br>
    these spluttered fits found fit for show. <br>
    You wished a cancer nibbled off, <br>
    and laid down on the public trough. <br>
</p>
<p>
    She braves the crowd filled first from sides. <br>
    She might complete your jigsawed life. <br>
    With hair of maraschino red, <br>
    "Great show," she later said. <br>
</p>
<p>
    Well there are ways to make a treat of life, <br>
    and you were fine when you had none. <br>
    But knowing now what you'd missed out on, you find, <br>
    you look back in anger that it's done. <br>
</p>
<p>
    When religious kids mocked, each hypocrite's taunts<br>
    would just acquit God of further need; <br>
    reading His obit not a bang, just a murmuring. <br>
    Now each new concession sees this peasant<br>
    discontented all the more, <br>
    with his ignorance lessened of his plight before... <br>
</p>
<p>
    Beyonders prevail, the letters preached, <br>
    and thus secure, must turn the cheek. <br>
    You waved your pledge to this godly good, <br>
    only to crack, sprawled where they stood... <br>
</p>
<p>
    Though, if you're right to want what's yours, <br>
    weren't they right to take what's theirs? <br>
    So if you're weeping for poor squirrels, <br>
    also weep for poor, poor bears. <br>
</p>
<p>
    Red and friends, lagging by the back door, <br>
    lift you on angel stares. <br>
    Drunk, you'd claim you've never loved, <br>
    but it's too late to unscrew a Bud... <br>
</p>
<p>
    Yes, you were wrong to make demands on life, <br>
    'cause when you beg it never comes. <br>
    And we all find this out on our own time... <br>
    Look back in anger to have won.<br>
</p>
