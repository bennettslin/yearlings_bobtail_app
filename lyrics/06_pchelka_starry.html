<h1>Pchelka's Starry Journey</h1>
<p>
    <i>But F., that man is the worst nuisance on the beach.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    Mother, woken from her nap,<br>
    hears a piercing scream and thunders,<br>
    "Why'd you hit your baby brother, when he so looks up to you!<br>
    Don't you remember days past,<br>
    when you wanted to buy a fortress<br>
    but your daddy couldn't afford it,<br>
    so you brought him into your room?<br>
</p>
<p>
    You stowed away beneath your captain bed.<br>
    We didn't hear a peep throughout the entire weekend!"<br>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Poor Sam Peabody!</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    Oh brother, when all you know is bleat,<br>
    they'll catch you by your cape and beat you,<br>
    threatening never to release you till you learn to kick it back.<br>
    Feigning sick, I chanced to read<br>
    these words in a comic to me speaking:<br>
    "Are you tired of being the weakling?"...<br>
    I clipped and mailed the ad.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Soon send away offers were piling up high,<br>
    and then one day one came and made me cry and cry.<br>
    Red pouches unspent for years, at once counted and sent,<br>
    while all the weeks I waited, weighing those words in bold text:<br>
</p>
<p>
    "Are you a Beyonder sent down to be Earth-fostered;<br>
    do you often feel like a wanderer lost?"<br>
    But waiting for Goddard, our two impatient paupers,<br>
    Gogo and his Didi, sauntered off...<br>
    Till in hunger they were led into Huntsville and fed,<br>
    dragged to sled by hunter's belt and launched!<br>
</p>
<p>
    "Far from home and shaped like common men,<br>
    Beyonders bleed the most, their roots unknown to them.<br>
    We've received your fee, and per the tests,<br>
    you are indeed a seed from that nebular nest.<br>
    Is this too much at once? We're trusting mum's to be the word.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Beyonders pine for a love no mortals give,<br>
    one they'll find only once we build the mothership.<br>
    Your monthly tithe shall fund good tidings soon to come.<br>
    But till then, here's how you're to live..."<br>
</p>
<p>
    So thus we learned to act the dunce<br>
    as spies among the carnal fallen,<br>
    twin friars cast here in pollens from a star's placenta sac.<br>
    Braced for an earth stay unloved,<br>
    twits daily murdered for their virtue.<br>
    Mirthful, the merciless would hurt you,<br>
    as omerta turned their backs.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Stung by venomous vipers, our muted youths lapsed;<br>
    we knew the shortest cyphers are the toughest ones to crack.<br>
    But every hero has a heel, we'd realise, blind before the squad.<br>
    The only spies who get to feel love first unearth their own plots!<br>
</p>
<p>
    Mushing onward, Mushka's dragged by collar<br>
    to his slaughter under undying dawn.<br>
    Choked, he's soon a goner, no one heard his hollers;<br>
    this pack honours only the idiot's rod.<br>
    Next cabins come equipped with pentobarbitone syringe,<br>
    nothing too rich for glorious cosmonauts!<br>
</p>
<p>
    I'm sorry I bailed, Xiao Xiang, mush on...<br>
    I couldn't ditch my wails, I needed the pod.<br>
    "Kids say you're hopped on drugs, son.<br>
    With Mum we'll need a word."<br>
    Mushka, per their bargain, I can't ever return.<br>
</p>
