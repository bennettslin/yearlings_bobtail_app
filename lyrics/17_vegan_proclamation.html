    <i>"If you're just starting out, you need to decide right now:<br>
    either you stick with quality vinyl, or you buy only the bargain bin LPs;<br>
    you can't have both. Because a scratched record will chip a good needle...<br>
    and a chipped needle will scratch a good record..."</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    So shall we, Odin, lightly tread<br>
    past the rape racks where our furor led, <br>
    to a soiled girl fouled on the false rib from our chest? <br>
    We baulked at our lives born unfair, <br>
    set to rock this pout from horse to chair, <br>
    as a tempered hammer cooled by striking the smouldering air... <br>
    Well, first pets always bear the worst, <br>
    mere primers on how not to hurt, <br>
    and now I know why the battered kitten purrs... <br>
</p>
<p>
    <i> "No, I'll smile because I believe in the big crunch, <br>
    and meanwhile, the universe is a cyanided box... <br>
    Because if we can't ever be known to be dead, <br>
    we just might always be alive to God..."</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    Torn straps unsalvaged sows have chewed, <br>
    form a trail which leads to a bloody broom, <br>
    its bristles scrape discharge encrusted on leather boots. <br>
    Through an alley strewn with burger shrouds, <br>
    a lone rallied youth strikes himself from his cloud, <br>
    reversing his stomach and his swastikas inside out... <br>
    Well, if first cuts are the worst ones bled... <br>
    then none by us now, to any flesh! <br>
    This shipwrecked world is large enough for us to make amends... <br>
    and to be good again... <br>
</p>
<p>
    "So all your leads have left and now you're sad, too? <br>
    Someday you'll breathe again; for one, you have to... <br>
    I don't know how where once I cowered I now could fly.<br>
    I still love you for the airholes, dear; and now, good night." <br>
</p>
<p>
    The stardust marks us, Odin, sparks zip through our heads... <br>
    And can we start as children? Would we want to then? <br>
    The diapered white dwarf, gurgling, curls up for his sleep... <br>
    Our ashed heads bow from chivalry to our Siva's feet... <br>
</p>
