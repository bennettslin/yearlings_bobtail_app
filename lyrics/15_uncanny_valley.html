<h1>Uncanny Valley Boy</h1>
<p>
    Beta, come wax prophetic with me.<br>
    Rest your rump, boy, by your old giving tree. <br>
    Stumped, I ponder the forespoken monster at the end of this book of yours...<br>
    And you, for a future, sold your whole fortune<br>
    to live neutered, blissfully and orphaned. <br>
    Upon purchase of a queen's ship, earth right now your tourist store... <br>
</p>
<p>
    But distracted by your brother's tantrums, <br>
    we couldn't imagine your mail order cult, <br>
    till they called, suspecting you of huffing, <br>
    then we caught you stuffing twenties in an envelope... <br>
    So do you believe your "hamartia" now? <br>
</p>
<p>
    Oh, bastard ingrate! Some nights you wake, <br>
    climb and survey the houses you've betrayed. <br>
    Scattered your beans over suburbia... <br>
</p>
<p>
    Mowed down by the tides, and inundated under in unfair fights, <br>
    you made a bunker that shuts airtight to seal out their floods. <br>
    But then, my little prince, safe on your tiny planet where none else fit, <br>
    you finally granted their nutshells are rigged, and healed round your grudge... <br>
</p>
<p>
    Now suddenly dressed to play, you drowned your stutter, <br>
    smugly prepped to haze the new latecomers. <br>
    This scheming crackpot vowed to clean the jackpot out this time around... <br>
</p>
<p>
    But have you heard, my beloved Rama king, the testifiers' lore? <br>
    A nation paused to watch you fail your Sita on repeat for evermore! <br>
    Did you find a rival in the goddess you once sought as prize--<br>
    your idol who riled you when you saw that you two were tied? <br>
</p>
<p>
    With bride you bridled in this perfect duel match, <br>
    and so one night you chalked the sidewalks slurring Valmiki's chant. <br>
    When wakened from the siren, you found spelled out in dead ants: ____...<br>
</p>
<p>
    No well worn sari could sway you from a fairer marathon! <br>
    Your dulling gold now gone... <br>
    Stubborn harpies can't draw this contest to be one! <br>
    ...traded in for the trophy blondes. <br>
</p>
<p>
    Through tatters of sky, their sun tinkles light <br>
    in needling chimes that weave through the vines, <br>
    cast on your peons, old and subservient. <br>
</p>
<p>
    Oh child of mine, what's left of what these faces you flip override, <br>
    and all these pages you've ripped from your spine to find a cleared path<br>
    in life's unbearable maze? Then once for all to render it all fail-safe, <br>
    your thoughts surrendered for Bobtail's sake, to five-year plans. <br>
</p>
<p>
    Now son, before you embark on your great bildungsroman, <br>
    shouldn't you first be sure you've finally become someone? <br>
</p>
<p>
    Rama, Rama, Rama...<br>
</p>
<p>
    ...Maranatha! <br>
</p>
