<h1>Cremated</h1>
<p>
    Or another... <br>
</p>
<p>
    Atavist stuck feet first,<br>
    subversive inner lotus eater, <br>
    an everlasting doublespeaker,<br>
    his beaten wit and id she's deemed her sinking ship, <br>
    maybe good for anecdotes.<br>
    As comedy teams work, a hoot the times<br>
    not at each other's throats. <br>
    <i>At a vista, key turned</i><br>
    <i>to first switch in her low two-seater, </i><br>
    <i>and deaf from blasting frontal speakers, </i><br>
    <i>this phoenix risen limp beneath her pinkish slip, </i><br>
    <i>making scroonched her pantyhose.</i><br>
    <i>His god humming Freebird, the hula guy</i><br>
    <i>nods as she drums her toes. </i><br>
</p>
<p>
    Trophy bronzed from a Trojan<br>
    for some unforeskinned virgin, <br>
    on the shelf, serves his declared assertion: <br>
    to remain inherently perfect, <br>
    as worn puppet his offscreen person dubs. <br>
    His silent dramedy works better; <br>
    twitching sword in care, he's anyone. <br>
    <i>Though, she ponders the children</i><br>
    <i>born from a forced conversion</i><br>
    <i>on a self-servicing cleric surgeon</i><br>
    <i>duly may inherit his burdens. </i><br>
    <i>This swarm pumped and kissed off, she purges up, </i><br>
    <i>despite once promising forever, </i><br>
    <i>which she swore when scarcely twenty-one. </i><br>
</p>
<p>
    Needle done will not retract, <br>
    it hums a typo fragile ex passed through ash... <br>
    With his vinyl, exit Miriam to cash his stash.<br>
    Undeluded, she'll bask in selfish cut-off jeans, <br>
    and in her pool, hears not a worrisome "Bless her, Godspeed..." <br>
</p>
<p>
    The key turned and she floors it, <br>
    so homeward the sport's escorted, <br>
    the cleaved horizon pours the mortar in.<br>
    Redressed, he gets his notice, short an<br>
    apology, bold and blunt. <br>
    Life's a dumb ex-dromedary, hungry carrying<br>
    this groovy second hump. <br>
    <i>The seat hurt when he lowered it, </i><br>
    <i>though no worse but for his soreness,</i><br>
    <i>this geezer's life-support's abortive.</i><br>
    <i>He's vegging with his boner shortened; </i><br>
    <i>a pop, and she pulls the plug. </i><br>
    <i>Lights one up then draws a daring puff, preparing</i><br>
    <i>the scoop, he's getting dumped. </i><br>
</p>
