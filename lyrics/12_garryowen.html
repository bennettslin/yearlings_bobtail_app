<h1>Garryowen</h1>
<p>
    Brushed her off tonight, to swipe meats and wine<br>
    with your crew of chefs and thieves. <br>
    Tonight the rubber off, she offered as a thought, <br>
    if you would opt for bed not street. <br>
    Well you're not me, Garryowen. Oh no, and<br>
    I can't speak for this life you've chosen. <br>
</p>
<p>
    Drunk pissed punks tryst, bustin' cars with fists, <br>
    the littlest fuss will incite your rage. <br>
    In you come, piss drunk, smug in smegma crust, <br>
    since hummers aren't love, or so she's claimed... <br>
    Well see, Garryowen, now no one, <br>
    buys your grief as the boy unchosen. <br>
</p>
<p>
    So the celibate you'll play, self-medicated, <br>
    stewing in hatred for the world. <br>
    Slammed in the well, you'll glimpse yourself <br>
    with choler turned up, cringing in shame. <br>
    As claws you built from scratches, with your bilious malice, <br>
    fill up a package strapped to your scapegirl, <br>
    You'll slap her down, and push her out, <br>
    a crumpled castaway! <br>
</p>
<p>
    Your rabid wit unleashed, Garryowen, to no end, <br>
    you'd make her strip bare just to watch her freeze. <br>
    You won't always have her for your pet. <br>
    Someday she won't be there; someday yet! <br>
</p>
<p>
    Final trip on a tanker, you'll drop your anger<br>
    to which you've chained her; she'll sink into<br>
    the briny end. Now that you're cleansed, <br>
    aren't you the faltering dear? <br>
    They told her, "Never help a self-abuser<br>
    see himself as well in you." <br>
    You'd smite your kitten good, galled that smitten<br>
    she would opt just not to hear! <br>
</p>
<p>
    Toora-loora-li, Garryowen, who owes no one, <br>
    becomes someone's last-ditch alibi. <br>
    You're a purer lie... <br>
</p>
