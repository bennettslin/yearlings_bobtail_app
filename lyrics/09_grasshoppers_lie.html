<h1>Grasshoppers Lie Heavy</h1>
<p>
    <i>L.A. to the Bay, pompous autumn waits.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    Uprooted, then en route,<br>
    eighteen threw off the brutes<br>
    and their molls perched on pedestals,<br>
    noses in penny dreadfuls.<br>
    For a cafeteria's wage,<br>
    death of dull dishroom days<br>
    stalled by keys left on dumbwaiter trays.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Down the steps to fetch her lancet pen,<br>
    and stunned, by reflex you asked.<br>
    At first she hedged, but then laying qualms to rest:<br>
    schwa stickers attached to your sci-fi paperback.<br>
</p>
<p>
    First date nosebleed spurs tales of bare-knuckle defeats...<br>
    Snowflakes in time come to see off the year.<br>
    You cried for one to sit; it kissed your ear.<br>
    Her show played in mimes, but you pleaded to hear.<br>
    Then just like the drift, she disappeared...<br>
</p>
<p>
    <i>With no sister ship slain by his side,<br>
    and so off her list, sunken Tirpitz lies.</i><br>
    Alone his first gig, stagefright ignites.<br>
    But no convert's missed, once assured his tithe.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Homeward, mop-sopped to your knees.<br>
    Tonight, just sour grapes, bitter sweets<br>
    left to brave February's brutal gust;<br>
    chimneys weep sooty dust.<br>
    Phantom limbs trip left and right<br>
    them tripped on runner's high.<br>
    Below the window of your Walkman you hide.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Your gate code punched, when a looming shadow nears,<br>
    as your heartbeats, her steps, race to first.<br>
    And she deftly thrusts through the shield of your sneer:<br>
    "Hey, you know you're my password?"<br>
    I am? "Well, you're backward..."<br>
</p>
<p>
    She locks your arm. Key turned, returned to your guard...<br>
    In her gingerbread prison, here now you submit.<br>
    Though never full, you're fed; so you hit the switch.<br>
    On your bed's rumpled linens, a lidless Vaseline sits.<br>
    "Shall I leave you," she says, "here to Philip Dick?"<br>
</p>
<p>
    Thoughts sift in the waiting room:<br>
    Why does she play bright to your gloom<br>
    past a year on a stalled friendship's sails?<br>
</p>
<p>
    On a malady your thoughts are stuck,<br>
    and the organ on which it struck,<br>
    in the everpresent scent of her trail.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Then you wake by a bell with a ring.<br>
    In her white gown, crept up she beams;<br>
    and you marvel, glimmer of her cheek unveiled.<br>
</p>
<p>
    She loves you...<br>
</p>
<p>
    ...and now you're left with no defences. Well, who'd have guessed this?  You stand unsure. She lures with a tease, "Oh sweetie, you're right: you wear your hard-on in a sleeve." So how's that compromise?<br>
</p>
<p>
    And dude, you love her. When your paws were thrashed sparring with the tide, from your Grace Darling's beacon light fell an oar. Let pure lose to pure...<br>
</p>
<p>
    You stroke her temples. She gushes as she guides,<br>
    and pulls you up inside her thighs.<br>
</p>
