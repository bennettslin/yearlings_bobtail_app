<h1>On a Golden Cord</h1>
<p>
    On a golden cord, once worn, now shorn, <br>
    safely kept with bread and pocket lint. <br>
    Not of its own accord, but broken for what its promise meant. <br>
    And so she said, "Now it's yours again... <br>
    And how you look tonight! <br>
    So polite, yet resigned, with wounds dressed and feelings put away. <br>
    Full of patient replies... But how can I trust a word you say? <br>
    So spill away.. and please, dear, you have no more secrets saved. <br>
    I'm sorry, but I went through your mail today..." <br>
</p>
<p>
    Immerse the moulted form in holy foggy night, <br>
    emerged beside a pauper's grave from dreams. <br>
    The wraith surveys the widow on his pyre; <br>
    torched the bellyaches on suttee. <br>
    <i>Returned a golden cord, this sole belonging signed.</i><br>
    <i>Leave early, time's up, cross your date released. </i><br>
    <i>The jailer waves a bit, though uninspired, </i><br>
    <i>for the well-behaved on the wing. </i><br>
</p>
<p>
    Had I grown dispirited in all this act, <br>
    by disparate elements, like kindling gathered up? <br>
    Guilt pardons the spectre taunting twin streetlamps; <br>
    hatchet man who's burnt enough. <br>
    <i>As I soak in spirits amidst wanted ads--</i><br>
    <i>my desperate ailments tied in this shambler's dusk--</i><br>
    <i>still hardened against her fawning, misty glance, </i><br>
    <i>past this avenue Möbius. </i><br>
</p>
<p>
    But a precious gift as a shedded chain, <br>
    has lain to rust, one more cruel memento. <br>
    Then if life were real, not just drunken play...<br>
    But what do I know?<br>
    <i>But the present slips past a debt unpaid, </i><br>
    <i>that slays you once before you'll let it go. </i><br>
    <i>And if night were peeled off the front of day...</i><br>
    <i>But what do I know?</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    Just that those playful pups with their hateful fangs<br>
    knew the restraint of those born as hunters, <br>
    while this supposed dove chafing in his cage, <br>
    just learned he's pecked to death his precious other.<br>
    But should it matter since you loved her once, <br>
    when you really thought the world that simple? <br>
    And who's to judge how much you cared because<br>
    the gesture then was just a little more worth working for?... <br>
    <i>Mush! Mush!</i> <br>
    Now the jester teeters towards... <br>
</p>
<p>
    the taunting, streetswept dawn. <br>
    Thoughts spawned then dropped, of gathering up the suttee dust. <br>
    Some things just come to loss: <br>
    this bracelet, its lustre; me, my lust. <br>
    Or was I once, something not what I've become? <br>
    Have I just killed the thing I love? <br>
</p>
<p>
    Of fateful thoughts hung on a gilded clasp, <br>
    which this Ubermensch reavowed he'd come to snip. <br>
    And a smarting head throbs once his brain's warring halves, <br>
    each attack with the proper fist. <br>
    <i>Once navels locked upon the wilted grass,</i><br>
    <i>digging through her innie, the outie snug-to-fit. </i><br>
    <i>Then the guardian knot of this frayed cord detached, </i><br>
    <i>leaked the bandage upon her wrist. </i><br>
</p>
<p>
    A sober plea finds the present you, <br>
    my alias drunk, in panic and starved for leads. <br>
    And will she label lies oaths we vowed we could, <br>
    with Garry's sole witness relieved?<br>
    <i>The former me might have left a clue</i><br>
    <i>by trail of crumbs, which vanished as bartered feed. </i><br>
    <i>Until we strangle cries knowing how we stood, </i><br>
    <i>when buried whole with the deceased. </i><br>
</p>
<p>
    So a plan devised divides a slave once wed; <br>
    a bid for greatness' sake, he's sold on as holy war. <br>
    When longed by nothing you then fight the best, <br>
    for kohl-eyed houris as reward. <br>
    <i>Though, the master mind reminds us, straight ahead, </i><br>
    <i>a bigger plate awaiting nulls one half full before.</i><br>
    <i>And fond sighs of reunion I must rest; </i><br>
    <i>forego like jewelry that she wore. </i><br>
</p>
