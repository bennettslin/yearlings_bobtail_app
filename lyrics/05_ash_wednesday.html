<h1>Ash Wednesday</h1>
<p>
    O Catherine! My Catherine! our futile trip is done<br>
    where it commenced: in my bookless room,<br>
    Ulysses' tomb, surely buried she'd be!<br>
    First we laid Tourette's, next regrets,<br>
    the last day she rose up and left, hers the sole assent...<br>
    But saving herself strictly for marriage, or really from me?<br>
</p>
<p>
    Oh and for Catherine, St. Catherine of God,<br>
    I purge, with a dirge she'd deride,<br>
    with sadness, sad for what I am not:<br>
    a soul to share in her eternal life.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Oh Catherine, pressed for an opinion, sighed,<br>
    "My, what wit, man," putting down her Joyce,<br>
    with "Joyce" oblivious to the trump she just played.<br>
    Couldn't heaven, her heaven,<br>
    brimming over with smart boys, fit just one art boy<br>
    who tried but failed to win her heart poised with brains?<br>
</p>
<p>
    And as I pace, stranded here outside her Shelta,<br>
    in famous raincoat unknown to roam,<br>
    my girl in glasses went clear--my Tekakwitha--<br>
    for I lack the wit to spare a safe Algonquin abode.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Well yes, I faked this "X", I should confess,<br>
    using some old used cigarette.<br>
    "So you'd cheat your way into heaven," she might protest.<br>
    Well no, I know it's wrong, but I did burn my palms,<br>
    I guess that butt was still fresh.<br>
    Et Catherine vaut bien une messe...<br>
</p>
<p>
    On this sad day to mourn<br>
    us wretched souls cursed to be born,<br>
    a spark zips through my head to be<br>
    mistaken for Catholic with some smeared ash;<br>
    to wear it like a tragic mask.<br>
</p>
<p>
    On this Ash Wednesday morn,<br>
    in spreading mole my sickness borne<br>
    upon this head for all to see.<br>
    And maybe if Catherine sees, she'll ask,<br>
    "So where'd you attend Mass?"<br>
</p>
