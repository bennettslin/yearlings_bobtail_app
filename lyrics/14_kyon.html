<h1>Kyon?</h1>
<p>
    So you fled to her nest on this stork,<br>
    history shed, having never grown your horns. <br>
    A present sent to her of a newborn... <br>
    So baby, tell me then, when you take in her breasts, <br>
    are you suckling to be fed? <br>
    Is it just her womb you bed? <br>
    Well, have some more... <br>
</p>
<p>
    And how you always burned, for the slight; <br>
    spurned at first, you couldn't let it die! <br>
    You'd nurse your bruises: why, the nerve of me, to lie<br>
    in reserve while I had to learn to find<br>
    all the points you had! Then you'd resent<br>
    plunders past that forced my defence... <br>
    But dear, let's make a pact: if you're single then, <br>
    I get you back? And... <br>
</p>
<p>
    I'll be stronger--not a bother, more modest, I promise--<br>
    to parent my knight-errant as the sole keeper of his sheep herd. <br>
    And when sobered by the time-lapse to spring forward on a fallback... <br>
</p>
<p>
    my ticklish piglet, you'll bounce back to me, giggly, having fully gorged yourself. <br>
    Bursting belly told by extra holes punched in your belt. <br>
</p>
<p>
    A shank's dustless silhouette bares the sill's sheen, <br>
    your severed stinger left in me never lost its sting. <br>
    But other nights you'd lap my wound clean <br>
    to leave me as before, with only instinct to adore. <br>
    Besides, a you-shaped pussing sore<br>
    bleeds just once, then never more...<br>
    So are we agreed, honeybee? Come for me? At thirty-three? <br>
</p>
<p>
    You say you woke one crystal morning, to find all those thoughts had gone away: <br>
    your fear of death, your fear of never dying, and sadness for what it was. <br>
    You just knew Bobtail's your priority, so for Bobtail I'll gladly wait. <br>
    And darling, don't you worry, these were only practise cuts... <br>
</p>
