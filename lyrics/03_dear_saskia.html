<h1>Dear Saskia</h1>
<p>
    Dearest Sasha,<br>
</p>
<p>
    It's nearing autumn here with record highs.<br>
    Is it searing in Boston? Hope this letter finds<br>
    your first semester fine while I'm out of town...<br>
    You'd love Taiwan, surrounded by walls of mountains,<br>
    their peaks sealed and shielded by foggy clouds.<br>
    Beneath this ceiling yields the scene a reeling feel<br>
    of some giant's house.<br>
</p>
<p>
    So... before I left, you said<br>
    I should keep your kid name, with everything it meant.<br>
    But then in your embrace, I felt you prepped to shed...<br>
</p>
<p>
    And I'd reflect inside withering amber eyes--<br>
    your pupil's pupal fly, a pet petrified--<br>
    with you raving over how he's getting you<br>
    staying kosher. Though, you know, I would have too...<br>
</p>
<p>
    And I sniffled daily when you skipped a grade.<br>
    One bus seat up you moved, letting rippled braids<br>
    caress, sun-streaked and loose, a wet-cheeked papoose<br>
    sadly weaned from you...<br>
</p>
<p>
    Whom I knew I'd lose the day,<br>
    you flew enraged and shooed them from their game;<br>
    untied this "tetherboy", soothing in your lecture voice.<br>
    Oh but Sasha, if anarchy reigns,<br>
    then no one lives when narcing to the aides,<br>
    who shrug when thus annoyed, yawning, "Boys will beat boys..."<br>
</p>
<p>
    Well Sasha... okay, you saw the cuts.<br>
    But though my jaw was stuck, so now I talk Canuck,<br>
    there's been plenty days I've really been through worse.<br>
    Anyway, I'm feeling healed. Still, hugging hurts...<br>
</p>
<p>
    And Sasha, I know you'll have them all,<br>
    while if I last the fall playing possum<br>
    is a toss-up. But where some haemophile<br>
    might bleed the Nile to nausea,<br>
    I can wash up, and hope the bastards croak,<br>
    on rat turds choked.<br>
</p>
