<p>
    I was a lad bent on learning the talents<br>
    that all clever girls need to see.<br>
    Bit my sadness with patience,<br>
    with practise each day, then<br>
    in five years I'd be one to keep.<br>
</p>
<p>
    This moron marooned, a method mapped in my cocoon<br>
    to mould me into a mystery mensch.<br>
    No minutiae left unmastered,<br>
    music cred with mindful manners merge.<br>
    Once I metamorphose, certain I'd impress.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Year five, and now the one who dug me up<br>
    spent her wishes on a friend,<br>
    while forever I'll hold in peace these words unsaid.<br>
    Hopes wrapped in marinaded confections but<br>
    before tomorrow never sent.<br>
    Signed off "Love: Me" is how my life and letters end.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Morphined, I'll probably die pushing forty, exiled<br>
    to a sand castle built by low tide;<br>
    far too old to be martyred,<br>
    too young to grow smarter,<br>
    a mariner's child who hanged from this tie.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Panoramic prints pending my soon-to-be Moonie wedding,<br>
    fools once expecting their "Made in America" signs.<br>
    In a time capsule sealed<br>
    with pages of defeated spiels<br>
    lies that marionette in this heap of twisted twine.<br>
</p>
<p>
    All I know is that whoever finds me<br>
    keeps me solely for a pet.<br>
    With her "I do", my life in marriage<br>
    is choked down my no-hope chest.<br>
    Her lispy kiss unlucky for this chimney sweep,<br>
    indentures dumbed as a boy.<br>
    Whispered "adieu", I bade them to fare well,<br>
    then turned to hug the void.<br>
</p>
<p>
    But then I saw the world's a naked baby,<br>
    cradled safely in my lap.<br>
    It dropped a poop, but somehow I knew<br>
    to have a merry ol' laugh.<br>
    And now I wonder if the answer might be<br>
    to know: the rule for a girl<br>
    is that the boy who's to love her baby<br>
    should first love the world.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Moral is: it's up to me to be alert;<br>
    nothing comes a pure surprise.<br>
    Sometimes if it's all to work friends have to lie.<br>
    And sometimes situations seem the worst,<br>
    but in a year, they're never bad.<br>
    Five more, she'll dig up Bobtail's words--I'm not sad!<br>
</p>
