<h1>My 100,000th Dream</h1>
</p>
<p>
    My hundred thousandth dream, I bumped into my Sita.<br>
    Silent for a while, we searched our eyes, <br>
    then we smiled and like old times, <br>
    I took her shoulder as we drove from El Torito.<br>
    I said never again we'll slave our whole lives away! <br>
</p>
<p>
    As pretty as the rainbow, Sita! Sita! <br>
    Did I ever live another life? <br>
    As precious as a summer, Sita! Sita! <br>
    Did I ever live another life? <br>
    And were you mine? <br>
</p>
<p>
    My hundred thousandth dream, I kissed my senorita, <br>
    on the pampas where the gopis played, <br>
    and the seasons glide away. <br>
    I can't remember how or when my heart was Sita's. <br>
    We were young, so sure of life, never knowing time unkind! <br>
</p>
<p>
    I spent a lifetime waiting, Sita! Sita! <br>
    Did I ever live another life? <br>
    We blow the wind in whistles, Sita! Sita! <br>
    Did I ever live another life? <br>
    When you were mine? <br>
</p>
<p>
    My hundred thousandth dream, on the cliffs of El Cerrito, <br>
    she says now it's dark and getting late, <br>
    but we'll always have today. <br>
    Why does my last thought in this world belong to Sita? <br>
    Now the light spills warm and bright... gently fills these eyes... <br>
</p>
<p>
    She'll always come to take me, Sita! Sita! <br>
    Will I ever live another life? <br>
    Real or imaginary, Sita! Sita! <br>
    Will I ever live another life? <br>
    When you'll be mine? <br>
</p>
