<h1>Willy the Cocoa</h1>
<p>
    Hilltops gnashing dig out potholes,<br>
    the valley somersaults in tarred pavement mirage.<br>
    Hydrants burst as early worms work this dying coyote's jaw.<br>
    Swill pop poured from wayside bottle,<br>
    his pinhead in its shadow eclipsed in full.<br>
    <i>Chilled cola's free with salvage sold...</i><br>
    licking lips he ends his stroll.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Oh, has Willy the Cocoa come<br>
    for our tins and our jars this week?<br>
    Saluting Mummy doing some haircutting to the sun<br>
    when suddenly baby shrieks...<br>
</p>
<p>
    As gap-toothed coma parts his forehead,<br>
    launching pair of seizures to the patch.<br>
    Willy ducks behind the porch steps and laughs.<br>
    Oh ma'am, I see your kid with whiskers,<br>
    he croaks, stroking creepers on his cheek,<br>
    And three years howling is the longest cowlick yet I've seen!<br>
</p>
<p>
    Prying X-ray spec'd, enraged at pages clawed,<br>
    a kick slams the bearded baby to the ground<br>
    with his tummy clenched, muffling baffled sobs.<br>
    Papa storms in roaring, Boy, are you proud?<br>
    You'd learn him good, when smarts he could've took<br>
    all went instead to this clever head of yours.<br>
    So to baby--to your brother--you'll say sorry for the world!<br>
</p>
<p>
    Killcrop dashing kicks up puddle,<br>
    soused loafers shouting 'tard payment is due.<br>
    Hit this witch with switch, whispers wind, to fix his switcheroo...<br>
    Milksop cornered into scuffle,<br>
    a sack-spilled glass swung sounds the past-noon toll.<br>
    <i>Shelled skull has freed unsalvaged soul...</i><br>
    dripping Willy's stalkless bulb.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Oh, and August was the sawdust month<br>
    that saw this mulch soften asphodel.<br>
    Baby bluebonnets bloomed as new comics soon<br>
    lay forgotten amongst the mail.<br>
</p>
<p>
    But how marbleless, some reckoned,<br>
    being ever stuck in imp-runt age of mind!<br>
    Are you sick? I am seven, he'd reply...<br>
    And do we speak in winded whimpers<br>
    or squelch shreds of a summer gone,<br>
    ever conscious of days past forever wrong?<br>
</p>
<p>
    Such heavy fears, Mummy laughs,<br>
    for a cub not yet Webelos!<br>
    Son, seventy years and you'll be glad<br>
    to finally rest those creaking bones!<br>
    Life's like this quilt: patchy, then it fills...<br>
    In time with needle done, you'll write this book of yours.<br>
    Then to Willy, in the cover could say sorry for the world!<br>
</p>
<p>
    Bobtail's cover could say sorry for the world!<br>
    Oh, Bobtail's cover could say sorry...!<br>
</p>
