<h1>Didi</h1>
<p>
    Didi left the house this morning<br>
    wondering to himself, who would tie his shoes?<br>
    And he left alone because he<br>
    had to finish up all his orange juice.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Didi, you've been following, I didn't want you here.<br>
    Didi, couldn't you find another sister to be near?<br>
</p>
<p>
    Cause I get sick of hearing, "Zeizei, let Didi play with you..."<br>
    And I tire of saying, "My Didi wants to come too."<br>
</p>
<p>
    Didi made an "accident" in class,<br>
    so the nurse sent him home, snickered the recess crowd.<br>
    They saw him crying beside a Safeway paper bag,<br>
    decked in overalls from the lost and found.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Didi, you've been in the bath all this time.<br>
    Didi, come out, you can't soak there all night.<br>
    <i>Don't little raisin fingers need to dry?</i><br>
</p>
<p>
    Didi, someday you will be a hero<br>
    in the movies, fighting those<br>
    crooked thieves with your sheriff's badge and gun...<br>
    Didi, one day you will be a picture<br>
    taped to all the girls' mirrors.<br>
    They'll say, who now could have ever figured<br>
    you'd finally become someone?<br>
</p>
<p>
    Didi dear, I'm sorry that I yelled at you that way.<br>
    Didi dear, I know today just wasn't your day.<br>
</p>
<p>
    And now I think all I want is my Didi well by tomorrow,<br>
    and there are things I hope my Didi will never know.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Yes, and now I think all I want is my Didi well by tomorrow,<br>
    and there are things I hope Didi will never have to know.<br>
</p>
