Hi Mark, I wish to ask for this recent agreement on the lighting situation to be renegotiated, and I would like this to be a point of discussion in our one-on-one tomorrow. I hope that the following points can be considered.

1) The negotiation was not conducted in good faith by the Network and Security teams. Early morning last Monday, Ryan Crawford approached me about turning the lights down. He told me that he had come back from a long absence, and I told him that his team had agreed to stuff their light fixtures to dim the lighting to their preference. He replied that this wasn't enough, which confused me, and so we went back and forth repeating ourselves, until he walked away. At no point did he mention a concern about fire hazards. Twenty minutes or so later, he complained in #sea_whine that the office lights were too bright. (Screenshot attached.) I then understood that he was talking about our lights, not theirs, and paid it no further heed.

In sending out that email, Ryan was a partisan advocating for his own preferences, not a fair-minded peacemaker staying above the fray, as we all know our managers aim to be. By including only himself and our managers in the discussion, he weighted the likely outcome towards his personal liking. As such, I respectfully ask for any future discussions that involve him to include me as well.

2) For those on both sides, this is an issue of accessibility, of mental health and psychological well-being, and of workplace safety. For some, dim lighting can cause drowsiness, or even depression. For others, the glare from bright lights can trigger headaches. Speaking for myself, being blind in one eye means that I lack depth perception and rely on visual cues for spatial awareness. Dimly lit surroundings make it that much harder to gather these visual cues, which strains my good eye further and wears me down in small but cumulative ways.

I have spoken with Heather Palmer, and this matter of office lighting is something that the ADAPT Network takes seriously. They are working with Facilities to find solutions to accommodate everyone's different needs, including light coverings that do not violate safety codes. In the meantime, I wish to ask for good intentions to be assumed on the part of those with strong opinions, on both sides.

3) Our teams can negotiate based on interests, rather than bargain for positions. Some time ago, I read a book on effective negotiation called Getting to Yes, which advises not to bargain for positions, as this leads to win-lose thinking. In other words, where one's gain always comes at the other's expense. I suspect that this is part of why the 50% solution feels so unsatisfying to myself and to others I've spoken with. The book advises instead to consider each side's respective interests, which encourages seeking out creative solutions for mutual benefit.

In this spirit, I would like to propose a creative solution, which everyone on the Applications team liked when I ran it by them at Von's. In exchange for our agreement to 50% lighting, we swap rows with the Network and Security teams. The couch area becomes ours, by sheer proximity. Here are some arguments in favour.

a) The basic formula for a win-win solution is that each side trades away something that the other side values more. I can't think of a better example than the couch area. None of us have ever seen them use it, and in fact, they don't seem to value any of the benefits of their location whatsoever. Their blinds are always down, and they allow Christopher Rogers to sit perpendicular with his back turned, precluding any chance for them to ever go up.
b) Meanwhile, we value their location highly. It gets more natural light in general, and the couch area would be a perfect nearby refuge for those who need a brightly lit area to boost their emotional well-being. On top of that, our teams are highly social and collaborative, and we would surely use the couch area round the clock. For standups, informal meetings, lunches, harbor watching, and so forth. We also have more spillover, like the dip station and our various snack tables, so we could definitely use the extra storage space.
c) By moving down from 38 to begin with, our teams have already sacrificed for the greater good in the latest company-wide move, while theirs have not. In this respect, one of Ryan's arguments to me, that they've been in their corner for three years, actually works against their favour, not for it. Had this lighting conflict been anticipated before the move, it's not hard to imagine a swap of this kind being proposed as a way for each team to share the burden, to no resistance on their part.
d) With 50% lighting, we are giving up more ground because we are twice their size, which counts as genuine leverage. Brian Capps acknowledged this himself, which I believe is the reason he was so willing to accommodate us under the original agreement. (Actually, we are giving up even more than that, because the average lighting throughout the day will always be lower than its initial setting, due to the downward adjustments that automatically get made throughout the day. I estimate that when set to 50%, the average will actually be around 40%. This is based on my limited observations, so I'm happy to have Facilities clarify this.)
e) It wouldn't be a strain on company resources. I have seen that when moving desks, the freight elevator is the only bottleneck. A crew of four would probably take no more than two hours to swap all the desks within our quadrant.
f) A related solution proposed by Brittany is that we sit by Velocity again, however it can be made to happen. Because they also prefer bright lighting, and are also dealing with a lighting conflict in their quadrant. These two solutions are not mutually exclusive, obviously.

4) If this solution is a nonstarter, here are some other suggestions that I hope our teams can ask for. I understand that it might not be realistic for some or even any of them to be granted, but I hope an attempt can at least be made.

a) Even if we don't swap rows, they agree that the couch area is "ours." In other words, we can rearrange it to our liking, place our bookshelves and dip station there, and so forth.
b) The lights are kept at 75% rather than 50%, given the points of consideration stated earlier.
c) We can turn the lights back to 100% past a certain hour in the afternoon, when everyone on their teams can be expected to have left.
d) The lights go back to 100% once light coverings are made available that do not violate safety codes, as the spirit of the original agreement can now stand with full approval by Facilities.
e) I will act as a representative of the ADAPT Network, and work with individuals on either side to accommodate their lighting needs. If they would like someone on their side to act in this capacity as well, I will be happy to work together.

Thanks so much for listening. I hope to discuss some or all of these points in our one-on-one tomorrow.

Best,
Bennett
