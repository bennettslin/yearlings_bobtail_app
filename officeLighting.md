Hi Mark.

1) This recent negotiation was not conducted in good faith by the Network and Security teams. Early morning last Monday, Ryan Crawford approached me about turning the lights down. He told me that he had come back after a long absence, and I told him that his team had agreed to stuff their light fixtures to dim the lighting to their preference. He replied that this wasn't enough, which confused me, and so we went back and forth until he walked away. At no point did he mention any concern about it being a fire hazard. Several minutes later, he complained in #sea_whine that the office lights were too bright. (Screenshot attached.) I then understood that he was talking about our lights, not theirs, and so I paid it no further heed.

In sending out that email, Ryan was not an impartial peacemaker trying to stay above the fray, as I know the managers aim to be. In choosing who would receive it, he had already weighted it towards the outcome of his personal liking. As such, I respectfully ask that any future discussion that involves him should include me as well.

2) For those on both sides, this is an issue of accessibility, of mental health and well-being, and of workplace safety. For some, dim lighting can cause drowsiness or even depression. For others, the glare from bright lights can cause headaches. Speaking for myself, being blind in one eye means that I lack depth perception and rely on visual cues for spatial awareness. Dim lighting makes it harder to gather these visual cues, which strains my good eye further and wears me down.

I have spoken with Heather Palmer, and this matter of office lighting is something that she and the ADAPT Network take seriously. They are working with Facilities to find solutions to accommodate everyone's different needs, including light coverings that do not violate safety codes. In the meantime, I would like good intentions to be assumed on the part of everyone with strong opinions, on both sides.

3) We can negotiate based on interests, rather than bargain for positions. I read a book some time ago called Getting to Yes that advises not to bargain for positions, as this leads to win-lose thinking. I believe this is why the 50% solution feels so dispiriting to myself, and to others I've spoken with. The book advises instead to consider each side's respective interests, which encourages creative solutions for mutual gain.

I would like to propose one such creative solution, which everyone on the Applications team liked when I ran it by them at Von's. In exchange for our agreement to 50% lighting, we swap places with the Network and Security teams. The couch area becomes ours, by sheer proximity.

// TODO. Following reasons.
a) I suspect that they don't even prize their location much to begin with. They keep their blinds down, and I never see them use the couch area. Meanwhile, our teams would certainly use the couch area round the clock.
b) Their location is better lit, as it gets more natural light. And the couch area is a natural refuge for those who crave light. It just makes sense for the teams that value bright lighting to sit there.
c) Our teams have already sacrificed our share by moving down from 38 to begin with. Had we anticipated this lighting issue at the time, it's not hard to imagine this swap being proposed as part of that move, to no one's resistance on their side.
d) We have twice as many people as they do, which counts as genuine leverage. Brian Capps even acknowledged this himself, which I believe is one of the reasons that he was so willing to accommodate us under the original agreement.
e) We could use the extra space as we have so much spillover, like the dip station and our various snack tables.
f) It wouldn't be a strain on company resources. I have seen that when moving desks, the freight elevator is the only bottleneck. A crew of four would probably take no more than two hours to swap the desks within a single quadrant.

// TODO.
a) Their teams agree to give us the couch area.
.
b) 2/3 of the way, given our respective sizes. 100% once light coverings are in place.
c) I will work with the ADAPT Network as an impartial advocate for both sides to ensure that each individual's needs are met.
