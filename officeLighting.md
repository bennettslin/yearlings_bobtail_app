I am writing this to just our two teams.

1) This recent negotiation was not conducted in good faith by the Network and Security teams. Early morning last Monday, Ryan Crawford approached me about turning the lights down. He told me that he had come back after a long absence, and I told him that his team had agreed to stuff their light fixtures to dim the lighting to their preference. He replied that this wasn't enough, which confused me, and so we went back and forth until he walked away. At no point did he mention any concern about fire hazards. Several minutes later, he posted in #sea_whine that the office lights were too bright. (Screenshot attached.) I then understood that he was talking about our lights, not theirs, and thus paid no further heed to the matter.

In short, Ryan is not an impartial peacemaker trying to stay above the fray, as I know the managers aim to be. In sending out that email, and in choosing who would receive it, he was advocating for an outcome of his personal liking. As such, I respectfully ask that any future discussion that involves him should include me as well.

2) For those on both sides, this is an issue of accessibility, of mental health and well-being, and of workplace safety. For some, dim lighting can cause drowsiness or even depression. For others, the glare from bright lights can cause headaches. Speaking for myself, being blind in one eye means that I lack depth perception and rely on visual cues for spatial awareness. Dim lighting and high contrasts make it harder to gather those cues, which stresses my good eye and wears me down. I have spoken with Heather Palmer, and this matter of office lighting is something that she and the ADAPT Network take seriously. They are working with Facilities to find solutions to accommodate everyone's different needs. In the meantime, let's assume good intentions on the part of those with strong opinions. 

3) We can negotiate based on interests, rather than bargain for positions. I read a book some time ago called Getting to Yes that advises not to bargain for positions, as this leads to win-lose thinking. I believe this is why the 50% solution feels so dispiriting to myself, and to others I've spoken with. The book advises instead to consider each side's respective interests, which encourages creative solutions for mutual gain.

Creative solution

1) In exchange for our agreement to 50% lighting, we switch rows with the Network and Security teams. The couch area becomes ours, by sheer proximity.

a) Their teams never seem to use the couch area, while our teams will use it round the clock.
b) Their area is better lit, as it gets more natural light. And the couch area is a natural refuge for those who crave light.
c) We could use the extra space as we have so much spillover, like the dip station and our various snack tables.
d) It wouldn't be a strain on company resources. I have seen that when moving desks, the freight elevator is the only bottleneck. A crew of four would probably take no more than two hours to swap the desks within a single quadrant.
e) We have twice as many people as they do, and this is genuine leverage. Brian Capps acknowledged this himself, which is one of the reasons that he was so accommodating under the original agreement.
f) We have already sacrificed 

In Getting to Yes, BATNA.
We respect the 50% agreement for now. Heather is discussing with Ian Grunfeld about light coverings approved by Facilities. Once those are available, we will go back to 100% lighting, with those who want dim lighting in their row opting for light coverings. Favour keeping shared environments bright, with custom solutions for individual workspaces. I am happy to be the point person for discussion related to accessibility and psychological health.
