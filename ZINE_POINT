Historically, indie rock has been all about celebrating and respecting the artists who hustle to get heard, who put themselves out there to build up a grassroots following. So in the early days of the internet, as it became apparent that the world was moving further online, there was a transitional period when everyone was trying to figure out, what are the online equivalents of the old school ways? A consensus was soon established that building a following on social media was the modern version of self-publishing zines and putting up flyers, that virality was the new grassroots momentum.

But now a decade later, a curious thing seems to have happened. Few out there seem able to muster any real enthusiasm when an artist uses their social media savvy to get ahead. This change in attitude was probably already forthcoming; the Trump years just sped it up even further. But if the very notion of celebrating and respecting an artist's initiative now seems absurd, why wouldn't that have always been the case? Maybe the absurdity was always there, and the internet simply made it obvious, by taking it to its logical conclusion.

This is a depressing thought, both for our early pioneers, and for all unknown artists. For the former, because it force us to question their historical worth. And for the latter, because indie rock fundamentally isn't set up to give a fair chance to every unknown artist based on full consideration of their music alone. The signal to noise ratio is simply too low. We need some measure that ensures only the most determined artists make it past the first round.

But there's good news for everyone. What if it was really the ingenuity of those early punk and indie rock pioneers, not their initiative, that we've been admiring all along? In other words, maybe our respect for them was never actually based on their courage and determination to hustle. Maybe it was always based on the fact that back then, the approach they took was novel and unprecedented for unknown artists to do. If what we value is ingenuity, then their contributions to music history are as secure as ever.

And the good news for unknown artists is that they can still show their determination in creative ways, beyond the formulaic and soul crushing grind of social media. For example, I'm putting out an audio webcomic, which is certainly novel and unprecedented. (While requiring no less initiative.) Who's to say 


In other words, I'm the one who more closely embodies the original spirit of the early punk and indie rock pioneers?
