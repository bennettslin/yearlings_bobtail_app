Historically, indie rock has been all about celebrating and respecting the artists who hustle to get themselves heard, who put themselves out there to build up a grassroots following. So in the early days of the internet, as it gradually became apparent that the world was moving further online, there was a time when everyone was trying to figure out what were the modern equivalents of the old school ways. A consensus became established that building an online presence through social media was the modern version of publishing zines and wheatpasting posters, that virality was the new grassroots momentum.

However, a decade later, a curious thing seems to have happened. Few out there seem able to muster any real enthusiasm when an artist uses their social media savvy to get ahead. This change in attitude was probably already forthcoming, and most likely living through the Trump years sped it up further. But doesn't this suggest that it's not so much the case that we were mistaken about what constitutes the modern version of putting up band flyers and stickers? That the very notion of celebrating and respecting an artist's initiative is, and always was, patently absurd? That the age of the internet simply made this obvious, by taking it to its logical conclusion?

If so, then this might be a depressing thought, both for our early pioneers, and for all unknown artists. For the former, because it force us to question their historical contributions. And for the latter, because indie rock fundamentally isn't set up to give fair consideration to every unknown artist based on their music alone. We need some measure to ensure that only the most determined artists make it past the first round.

But there's good news for everyone. What if it was really the ingenuity of those punk and indie pioneers, not their initiative, that we admired all along? In other words, we don't admire Iggy Pop because he had the courage and determination to hustle. We admire him because back then, the approach he took was the novel and unprecedented thing to do. In other words, their contributions are as secure as ever.

And unknown artists can still show their determination, it just won't be something as trite as social media

And now, I'm putting out an audio webcomic, which is also novel and unprecedented. (While requiring no less initiative.) In other words, I'm the one who more closely embodies the original spirit of the early punk and indie rock pioneers.

But what if
