# Portal section notes

### Annotation section

* Annotation card with portal has:
    * Song title
    * Song verse
    * Annotation card
    * Link to select the song and annotation
        * Link will also select verse of that song, unless it's the same song. (As in Odin.)
        * The cursor will be a "play this song" icon.

# Wiki section

* There will be no wiki popup. Instead it will be a link with target = blank or new. (The context can be anything.) http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/target_blank-vs-target_new/
    * The cursor will be a custom "exit to Wikipedia" icon.

# Accessibility

* Portal as accessed element should not change.
