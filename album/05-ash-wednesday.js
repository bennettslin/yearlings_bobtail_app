        /**
         In college, I dated a nice Catholic girl named Catherine, who didn't think much of my lack of reading habit and broke up with me right before Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent. So I decided to ash my own forehead and bump into her, thinking that if she could picture me as a good Catholic boy, I might get another chance. It didn't happen, but I did grow into a steady reader, and I probably have Catherine to thank for that.

         For a song about two people who couldn't be more different, I decided to juxtapose two musical genres that couldn't be more different, Arabic maqam and Renaissance polyphony. The Arabic quartertones were recorded by playing each instrument in two takes, the second time tuned a quarter tone flat. The shrieking whistles, which remind me of San Francisco's BART trains passing in opposite directions underground, were made by overblowing into recorders.
