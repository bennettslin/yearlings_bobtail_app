        narrative: 'I did a lot of Robitussin one college summer, and towards the end, I was pretty insane. I eventually regained my grip on reality, but the world always seemed different after that. A few years later, my friends Ana, Howie, Tomer, and I explored the steam tunnels under UCLA while high on Robitussin. I kept getting us to pretend we were Mongols and Vikings and other waves of human migration throughout history. In hindsight, they were probably just humouring me.',
        backstory: 'While reading <em>Finnegans Wake</em>, I was impressed by how Joyce uses literary puns to create multiple layers of meaning within a dreamlike setting. It seemed like the perfect device for conveying a Robitussin trip, in which time seems to stand still, and everything feels at once epic and unreal. The Police\'s <em>Ghost in the Machine</em> was also my soundtrack of choice on Robitussin, so I borrowed a bit of its style and atmosphere for this song.'
