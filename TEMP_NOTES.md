# TODO:
* Turn back on the feature to select all dots when annotation is in URL, in getDotsBitFromStorage.
* Lyric is in front of carousel when wiki selected.
* Lyric briefly in front of carousel when alternating between unit dots. Try just songwriting, and the two unit dot anchors in first verse in Good Night.
* Playing doesn't work from one song to the next?

* Make sure backstory and narrative tenses are correct.
* Get rid of % in wikis

* Pun annotations (going backwards)
    * 1 Odin
    * ...
    * Consider "sun tinkles light" annotation not being under the actual lyric?

* Songwriting annotations
    * 2 Sasha
    * Last one is Look Back.
    * 1 Vegan
    * Working backward.
* Make sure no wikis repeat.
