# Animation desired behaviour
* Bug: Why does CSSTransition appear not work for actors and certain things?
* Delay presence transitions in after cubes

* Use isLoaded for all classes for presence transitions.

* Presences animate out
* Cubes shift
* Presences animate back in
* Need to accommodate presences that don't change from one scene to the next.

* Already be thinking about delaying closer yIndices and actors
    * Have all entrance store transition durations be constants in a single file.

# Animation TODO:
* Initial stage
    * Temporarily hide curtain.
    * Make presences opacity none while scene change is not done.
        * Make sure transition out is smooth.
        * Make sure transition in is smooth.
            * Also reset scene index during scene changes.

* Cleanup
* Reshow curtain.

# Annotation edit TODO:
* Establish what exactly makes for a narrative, backstory, and observation.
* Make sure backstory and narrative tenses are correct.
* Reassess what is a wiki anchor.
* Make sure no wikis repeat.
* When to use italics and quotes for foreign words.
* Change more similarlys to likewises, and other phrases.

# Things to look out for.
* When to use "that."
* When to use "you" versus "one."
* When to use "help" without "to."
* When to use commas.
* When to use contractions.
