# TODO:
* Turn back on the feature to select all dots when annotation is in URL, in getDotsBitFromStorage.
* Lyric is in front of carousel when wiki selected.
* Lyric briefly in front of carousel when alternating between unit dots. Try just songwriting, and the two unit dot anchors in first verse in Good Night.
* Playing doesn't work from one song to the next?

* Make sure backstory and narrative tenses are correct.

* Songwriting annotations
    * 2 Sasha (one new one about the chorus chord changes)
    * 4 Garryowen
    * 1 Golden Cord
* Make sure no wikis repeat.

* Remove Britishisms from lyrics.
