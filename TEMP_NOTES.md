# TODO
* Presences should disappear once curtains are closed, at same time as cubes and sky are reset, but for some reason this isn't the case.
    * May need to be more strategic about using isStageDefault in presence store selector
    * Consider just changing scene index to -1 instead of isStageDefault?
    * Change curtains back to full opacity, of course.

# Post-Gatsby bugs
* Song banner animation when repeating song is janky. Not sure if pre or post Gatsby.

# Minor issues, to be investigated while production is on master before Gatsby.
* tips hand in garryowen for score

# Easy tasks
* Slider verse select ranges don't really align with hover ranges.
* Some todos to make a selector.
* Have verse store for queued verse select, just like annotation store.
* Make isActivated and isSelected selectors.
* Shorten constants to abbreviations?
