# Animation desired behaviour
* Allow multiple transitions per stylesheet. (Opacity and top)
    * Have opacity on all but actors.
* All presences slide in left or right by default.
* Have actors transition duration be longer upon entrance.
* Make sure animations and lyric scroll don't block each other.
* Wire animations
* Check if it's by yIndex or layerYIndex (Should be by regular yIndex).
* Bug: Presences sometimes lose their floor zIndex?
* Add overflow: hidden to presences that have trimBottom.

# Nice TODO:
* Have all entrance store transition durations be constants in a single file?

# Annotation edit TODO:
* Establish what exactly makes for a narrative, backstory, and observation.
* Make sure backstory and narrative tenses are correct.
* Reassess what is a wiki anchor.
* Make sure no wikis repeat.
* When to use italics and quotes for foreign words.
* Change more similarlys to likewises, and other phrases.

# Things to look out for.
* When to use "that."
* When to use "you" versus "one."
* When to use "help" without "to."
* When to use commas.
* When to use contractions.
