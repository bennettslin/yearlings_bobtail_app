# Current plan

# Later post-Gatsby work
* App loading indicator
* Why is Gatsby build so much bigger than webpack build?
* Gatsby for delivery and production scripts
* Tear down webpack code.
    * Still need GA in utils?

# Next work
* Scene doesn't reset to default when curtain is closed.
* Selecting carousel annotation will sometimes flash lyric above carousel.
* Banner filmstrip styling should get constants from constants folder

# Post-Gatsby bugs
* Song banner animation when repeating song is janky. Not sure if pre or post Gatsby.
* Failed to decode downloaded font warning?

# Minor issues, to be investigated while production is on master before Gatsby.
* Is song selection still slower through access after refactor?
* tips hand in garryowen for score

# Easy tasks
* Deprecated page for Internet Explorer?
* Experiment with removing from reducers and putting back in listeners to improve performance? Is this needed?
* Slider verse select ranges don't really align with hover ranges.
* Some todos to make a selector.
* Have verse store for queued verse select, just like annotation store.
* Make isActivated and isSelected selectors.
* Shorten constants to abbreviations?
