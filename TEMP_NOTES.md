* Make sure backstory and narrative tenses are correct.
* Get rid of % in wikis

* Pun annotations (going backwards)
    * 1 Odin
    * ...
    * Consider "sun tinkles light" annotation not being under the actual lyric?

* Songwriting annotations
    * 2 Sasha
    * 1 Good Night
    * Last one is Grasshoppers.
* Make sure no wikis repeat.
