# TODO:
* Turn back on the feature to select all dots when annotation is in URL, in getDotsBitFromStorage.
* Lyric is in front of carousel when wiki selected.
* Lyric briefly in front of carousel when alternating between unit dots. Try just songwriting, and the two unit dot anchors in first verse in Good Night.
* Playing doesn't work from one song to the next?
* Selecting wormhole doesn't scroll to annotation in carousel.

* Make sure backstory and narrative tenses are correct.
* Make sure no wikis repeat.

* Remove Britishisms from lyrics.
* Reassess what is an anchor.
* More casual talk.
* Make sure narrative and backstory are never together.

* Observation annotations
    * 1 Grasshoppers (Walkman)
    * 1 Good Night (pry)
    * 2 M (last two)
    * 1 Golden Cord (potter's field)
    * 1 Ash (Algonquin)
    * 1 Kyon (Hindu)
