# TODO:
* Turn back on the feature to select all dots when annotation is in URL, in getDotsBitFromStorage.
* Lyric is in front of carousel when wiki selected.
* Lyric briefly in front of carousel when alternating between unit dots. Try just songwriting, and the two unit dot anchors in first verse in Good Night.
* Playing doesn't work from one song to the next?

* Make sure backstory and narrative tenses are correct.

* Make sure no wikis repeat.

* Reference annotations
    * Search for anchorless references.
    * Also anchored references if I can find them.
    * 1 Pchelka ("mushing onward")
    * 1 Uncanny ("wax prophetic")

* Pun annotations
    * 1 Uncanny ("queenship")

* Remove Britishisms from lyrics.
* Reassess what is an anchor.
* More casual talk.
* Make sure narrative and backstory are never together.
