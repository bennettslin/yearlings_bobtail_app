# Illustrator files
* One per scene key. 89 total.
* Scale is relative to Bennett.
    * Bennett is 64" and 40 graph paper squares.
    * One cube is 12" and therefore 7.5 graph paper squares.
    * One graph paper square is 0.25 inches.
    * Canvas is 8 by 12 cubes, or 60 by 90 graph paper squares.
    * Canvas is 15 by 22.5 inches real life, 1080 by 1620 pixels.
* Have six Photoshop layers, one for each cubes layer.
    * All at same scale.

# File creation and placement
* Have grid guidelines based on cubes. Do between cubes as well. Have locked layer with numbered x and z indices.
* Recopy files.
* Just place files first.

# File arrangement
* Place in appropriate yIndices.
* Place in general x and z indices.
* Generally resize things to scale.

# Fine resize
* Show cubes in browser.
* Determine xIndex and yIndex for each file.
* Place the file in the appropriate yIndex layer and xIndex coordinate.
* Generally resize the file.

# Pre-Illustrator things
* The following were made using the legacy Photoshop to Illustrator method, where I would render first in Photoshop, then Image Trace > Line Art into vector paths.
