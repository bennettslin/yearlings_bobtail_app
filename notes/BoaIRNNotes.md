Trump vs Clinton
    If women and minorities are reluctant to advocate for themselves in the public arena, it's because a lifetime of having lived in their shoes has taught them that it's a waste of their time and energy to navigate that minefield of unconscious bias. It's a far better use of their time and energy to build up their talents, rack up their achievements, and then let their work speak for itself as they advocate for themselves in private arenas, building up alliances and partnerships. These allies and partners can then advocate for them in the public arena.
