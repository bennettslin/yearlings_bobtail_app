# Audio fix
* Figure out best GA.
    * Clarify logPlayer and logState labels?

# TODO
* dispatchPlay checks for player canPlayThrough. Does this account for logue?
* Weird time flash in song banner when selecting verse while song is playing.
    * Instead of setting state, use ref?
* Filmstrip transition is weird when selecting verse while song is playing.

* Is single mp3 needed to solve these potential problems?
    * Can audio repeat?
    * Can audio automatically play next song?
