Hi xxx, my name is Bennett and I'm in a rock band called Bobtail Yearlings.

(One or two lines to mention and compliment their work. Then tie their work or their interests to my project in the next line or two.)

We have a project called Yearling's Bobtail that's one part double album, one part audio webcomic. Here's a song:

And we promise to help rock music win the Pulitzer Prize! This is explained in our bio and project overview:

If you're intrigued by our project, would you be willing to spread the word about our Pulitzer promise? It could be a simple tweet, or a recommendation to someone who might want to work with us. This is a rather complex project to get off the ground on our own, so any help is appreciated!

If you have any questions, I'd love to answer them. Thanks so much for your time!

Best,
Bennett
