            `There's little risk in trying to scale a store, since each new store can repeat the same proven strategy. The downside is that scaling might not be possible. Since stores fulfill a known need, one isn't much different from the next. So wherever one competitor has opened a store, there's now less room for others.`

            `In other words, founding a startup is a risky venture at every step along the way. The upside is that the need to self-differentiate is baked into a startup's business model. So if its founders have correctly identified an unknown need that they can fulfill, then the path to scale and success is probably assured.`

A startup comes with more risk because it aims to fulfill an unknown need. And if it succeeds, then it creates a new market which it naturally dominates. For the investor, this means a much greater reward.`
