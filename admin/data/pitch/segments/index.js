            `Let's start by talking about the world of business. It's easy to paint all big companies with the same brush, but when they're starting out, they can be very different. Some begin as startups, and others as stores.`,

        text: [
            `So what's the difference? A store seeks to profit first, then scale. For example, Walmart began as a neighborhood store. Once that became profitable, Sam Walton opened another store in the next town over, and then another.`,
            `There's little risk in trying to scale a store, since each new store can repeat the same proven strategy. The downside is that scaling might not be possible. Since stores fulfill a known need, one isn't much different from the next. So wherever one competitor has opened a store, there's now less room for others.`

            `Unlike stores, a startup needs to scale first, even if this means going without profit in the short term. A good example is Google, which stayed unprofitable in its first few years until it reached millions of users.`,
            `In other words, founding a startup is a risky venture at every step along the way. The upside is that the need to self-differentiate is baked into a startup's business model. So if its founders have correctly identified an unknown need that they can fulfill, then the path to scale and success is probably assured.`

        text: [
            `If a startup makes no profit when it only has thousands of users, how could it suddenly turn profitable with a million users? One reason is the network effect, where a product offers more value to each user as more users use the product.`,

            `While stores are the oldest form of business, startups are more recent and behave differently. So in the early days, investors would often dismiss a startup as a bad deal, which was unfortunate. Since startups need to scale first before making a profit, they absolutely depend on investors for initial support.`,
            `This is why we now have the word "startup," to remind us that startups are their own thing. They're not simply stores that are more risky because they're less competent. A startup comes with more risk because it aims to fulfill an unknown need. If it succeeds, then it becomes the leader of a new market. And for investors, this yields a greater reward.`

            `Let's go back now to the world of music. For the past few decades, record labels have preferred to sign indie artists, who pose fewer risks. But it's no wonder why indie artists are less risky; they're like stores.`,
            `Indie artists typically gain fans by playing live shows. This is possible because audiences for shows already exist, and they arrive with certain expectations. In other words, indie artists fulfill a known need. And once an indie artist has grown a regional fanbase of a thousand, they can then repeat their strategy to win over the next thousand in a neighboring region, and then the next.`

If their artistic hunches are correct, then their path to scale and success might be assured. They'll be the only one of their kind to reach an audience that previously didn't exist.`,
            `Yet unless we recognise these artists as being their own thing, we'll only ever see them as less competent indie artists. Which is unfortunate, because like startups, these artists absolutely need initial support from others. So let's create a new word for them. I'll call them "artups."`
