            `There's little risk in trying to scale a store, since each new store can repeat the same proven strategy. The downside is that scaling might not be possible. Since stores fulfill a known need, one isn't much different from the next. So wherever one competitor has opened a store, there's now less room for others.`

            `In other words, founding a startup is a risky venture at every step along the way. The upside is that the need to self-differentiate is baked into a startup's business model. So if its founders have correctly identified an unknown need that they can fulfill, then the path to scale and success is probably assured.`

            `That's why the word "startup" is needed, because startups are their own thing. They're not just stores that are more risky because they're run less competently. A startup comes with more risk because it aims to fulfill an unknown need. If it succeeds, then it creates a new market which it naturally dominates. And for investors, this means a greater reward.`

            `Traditionally, indie artists win over their fans through live performances, where audiences have clear expectations. In other words, they fulfill a known need. And once an indie artist has grown a regional fanbase of a thousand, then they can repeat the same strategy to win over the next thousand in a neighboring region, and then the next.`

If their artistic hunches are correct and they're given the right support, then their path to scale and success is likely assured. They'll be the only one of their kind to reach the audiences that they themselves created.`,
            `Yet unless we recognise these artists as being their own thing, they'll always be at a disadvantage. We'll only see them as less competent indie artists and nothing more. So let's create a new word. I propose calling them "artups."`
