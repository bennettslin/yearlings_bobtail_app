    overview: `One night I went with my bassist Ana and some stoner friends to get high on Robitussin. As we explored the steam tunnels underneath UCLA, I got us all to pretend we were Vikings, Mongols, and various waves of human migration and conquest throughout world history; in hindsight, the others might've just been humoring me. I did so much Robitussin that summer, it took a while to regain my grip on reality.`,
