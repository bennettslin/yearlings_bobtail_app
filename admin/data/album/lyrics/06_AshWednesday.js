    duration: 163,
    overview: `In college, I met my first girlfriend. Catherine was a nice Catholic girl and former valedictorian, who didn't think much of my nonexistent reading habit and broke up with me right before Ash Wednesday. So I ashed my forehead and tried to bump into her that day, thinking if she could picture me as a good Catholic boy, then I might get another chance. It didn't work, but I did grow into a faithful reader, and I have Catherine to thank for that.`,
