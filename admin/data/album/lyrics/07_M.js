    overview: `After the breakup with Catherine, I vowed to spend the next five years shaping myself into the ideal romantic prospect. Toward the end, I started attending local shows and eventually cobbled together my own band, the Yearlings. There was a fellow scenester named Mara whom I noticed from afar, and soon I grew infatuated. But Mara ended up going out with my drummer Jacob, which made band practice awkward.`,
