    overview: `After the breakup with Catherine, I vowed to spend the next five years shaping myself into the ideal romantic prospect. I started attending local shows, and by year five, I had cobbled together my own band, the Yearlings. I kept running into a fellow scenester named Mara, and I soon grew infatuated. But Mara ended up going out with my drummer Jacob, which made band practice awkward.`,
