    duration: 244,
    overview: `Every night I dreamt of reuniting with Sita, only to wake up in a panicked sweat as the reality came roaring back that I'd lost her forever. I would slog through the day under a crushing blanket of despair, then crawl back into bed with dread, awaiting the cruel tricks soon to be played by my subconscious mind. I had no idea when this torment would end. The answer, I feared, was never.`,
