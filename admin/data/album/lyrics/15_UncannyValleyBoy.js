    overview: `Upon learning of my brother's autism, my parents were too harried to notice I was being bullied at school. In guilt, they later indulged every whim I had to find my own path. But as I got older, they grew concerned that I wasn't maturing as I went. On top of this, they were devastated when I left Sita, whom they adored. Naturally, I felt crushed by the weight of disappointing them. Still, I had a master plan to follow, and I wasn't about to change my ways.`,
