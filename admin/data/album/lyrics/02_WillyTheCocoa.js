    overview: `After my younger brother was diagnosed with autism, a neighbor told us about Willy the Cocoa, a mentally disabled man who'd once wandered the neighborhood collecting recyclables. Tragically, Willy was killed in a fight after some gangsters smashed his head open with a bottle. Hearing this story affected me to no end, and for years to come, I'd recall it whenever pondering my brother's likely future.`,
