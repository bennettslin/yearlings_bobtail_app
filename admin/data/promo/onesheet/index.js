        `Can a rock album ever win the Pulitzer Prize? It might seem unlikely. Today's rock music is loved for subjective qualities that don't spark discussion among literary scholars and musicologists the way hip hop can. But the Bobtail Yearlings are here to ask, why not try? And so they created Yearling's Bobtail, an ambitious multimedia project that merges a double album with an audio webcomic, in the belief that rock artists can aspire for more than popular appeal and critical acclaim. They can create classics worthy of academic study for generations to come.`,
        `Written and recorded by singer Bennett Lin, Yearling's Bobtail tells the autobiographical tale of an artistically inclined Asian boy growing up in Los Angeles, whose autistic brother and first crush on a Jewish friend force him to question his Buddhist upbringing. Bullied at school, he finds solace in a mail-order cult that instructs him to shut himself away. Years later, he embarks on a five-year plan for self-improvement that ultimately wins the hand of his first love, who brings him into her Hindu faith. But as his band gains exposure in the local scene, he bolsters his ego by seeking affection from other women, leading to heartbreak and loss.`,
        `Inspired by ambitious concept albums like Pet Sounds and Village Green Preservation Society, Yearling's Bobtail serves up memorable pop songs with folk instruments arranged in intricate counterpoint. The music is a hodgepodge of styles, from Tuvan throatsinging ("Pchelka's Starry Journey") and Arabic quarter tones ("Ash Wednesday") to Irish reel ("Garryowen") and honky tonk ("On a Golden Cord"). It also includes Shepard tones ("Cremated"), an auditory illusion in which a tone gradually descends in pitch while remaining fixed in place.`,
        `The lyrics follow in the footsteps of modernist writer James Joyce by employing such literary techniques as stream of consciousness ("Good Night, Sita"), meta-reference ("Grasshoppers Lie Heavy"), and neologistic puns ("Constellations!"). It even uses a technique of Bennett's own invention called doublespeaker rhyme, in which two sets of lyrics that rhyme syllable for syllable are panned hard to separate speakers ("Odin"), creating the musical version of a cinematic split screen.`,
        `The audio webcomic presents the story as a theatrical play, with illustrated characters and stage props animating in and out as the music progresses. Annotations offer background context for the lyrics, and links to Wikipedia help explain obscure references. Meanwhile, full music scores offer insight into how each song was composed.`,
        `Completed as an album a decade ago, Yearling's Bobtail was overlooked by the record labels and never released. At the time, with indie rock at peak influence, the term "bedroom recording" had become an insult, as artists were now expected to win over live crowds and master the administrative skills needed to bypass the labels. But sensing that this era couldn't last, Bennett instead learned the artistic skills needed to code and illustrate the audio webcomic.`,
        `After all, what's become of Donald Trump's era of peak influence? We no longer assume that winning over live crowds is the mark of a great leader. And every insult against Joe Biden has backfired because we now understand that real work can, in fact, be done in a basement.`,
        `Will today's music fans accept that the great rock albums of our time can, in fact, be made in a bedroom? The Bobtail Yearlings are betting on it!`,
