# Carousel notes

* Attach event handlers
    * Needs to pass annotation index as well (Where does portal get it?)

* Selecting annotation from lyrics should behave differently

* Bug where accessing annotation from lyrics makes overflow wonky in carousel

* Animate portal card fade out (content leaves too soon)
* Animate entire annotation fading out

* Height tall enough so no need to scroll annotation cards.
    * But if too tall, it covers dots-overview section

* Annotation without titles?

* Scrolling to from scrollIntoView

* Height too narrow?
