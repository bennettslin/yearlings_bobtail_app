# Carousel notes

* Consolidate annotation dot title and dot stanza into single button.

* Title includes dot stanza dot.

* Carousel scroll home doesn't work? When selecting new song.

* Scroll for first and last carousel annotations is wonky.

* Reset accessed annotation index strategically (before or after toggle?)

* Smarter button placement

* When switching lyric column, carousel should scroll to appropriate annotation
* Scrolling from portal.
