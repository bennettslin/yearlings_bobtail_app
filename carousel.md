# Carousel notes

* Consolidate annotation dot title and dot stanza into single button.

* Title includes dot stanza dot.

* Carousel scroll home doesn't work? When selecting new song.

* Scroll for first and last carousel annotations is wonky.

* Reset accessed annotation index strategically (before or after toggle?)

* Smarter button placement

* Carousel should hide annotations in hidden lyric column

* When switching lyric column, carousel should scroll to appropriate annotation

* Cremated last annotation "second hump," when hidden, still shows.
