# Carousel notes

* Attach event handlers
    * Needs to pass annotation index as well

* Selecting annotation from lyrics should behave differently

* Bug where accessing annotation from lyrics makes overflow wonky in carousel

* Disable in logue, and ensure animation is good
* Hide toggle in logues

* Animate portal card fade out (content leaves too soon)
* Animate entire annotation fading out

* Height tall enough so no need to scroll annotation cards.

* Annotation without titles?

* Scrolling to

* Can't click nav or carousel toggle when annotation popup

* Annotation cards should line up, make carousel height taller
