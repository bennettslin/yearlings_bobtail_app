# Darken notes

# Immediate TODO
* Rename to dark room

* Adjust wine bottle
    * Just get rid of wine top?
    * Get rid of label colours, just use general colours
    * Round out bottom, make side curve smoother
    * No need for wine bottle bottom to be its own class
        * Single wine bottle doesn't need bottom
    * See if these can also apply to other bottles

* Change bathroom colours to be more yellow

# Next TODO
* Autumn and winter foliage colours
* Night colours
    * Night cubes
    * Dark interior cubes? Apartment, club loading, El Torito
* Past, future, and magic colours
