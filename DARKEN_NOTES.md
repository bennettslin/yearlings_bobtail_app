# Darken notes

# Immediate TODO
* Condense NoHo house, apartment, El Torito exteriors
* Make attic rafters slanted
* Lighten darkened past colours for Bennett and Odin (Odin)

* Adjust wine bottle
    * Just get rid of wine top?
    * Get rid of label colours, just use general colours
    * Round out bottom, make side curve smoother
    * No need for wine bottle bottom to be its own class
        * Single wine bottle doesn't need bottom
    * See if these can also apply to other bottles

* Change bathroom colours to be more yellow

# Next TODO
* Autumn and winter foliage colours
* Night colours
* Past, future, and magic colours
