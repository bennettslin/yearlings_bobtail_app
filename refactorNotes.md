# Refactor notes
First wave of components to refactor.
(Delete when no longer needed.)

Folder/file structure organised
    Single word is top level class and component

Less constants
    All renamed, or accounted for elsewhere in a comment.
    Prefixed with JS if needed, make sure consistent

Class names optimised for clarity
    Favour appending more style-specific classes

Consolidate styles for child with parent selector nesting
