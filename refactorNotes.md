# Refactor notes
First wave of components to refactor.
(Delete when no longer needed.)

Folder/file structure organised
Less constants renamed without hyphens
Less constants consolidated in places that need them
Class names optimised for clarity
    Favour appending more style-specific classes
Consolidate styles for child with parent selector nesting
JavaScript constants corrected if necessary

Final stage:
Make sure javaScript and less constants are consistent.
