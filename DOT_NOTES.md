# Rules for categorising annotations

# Pun
* It's a pun if there is an additional meaning of the word implied that is not immediately clear from the context of the lyric itself.

* Add double quotes around any spelling in the annotation is different. Only wrap quotes around the part that is differently spelled.
    * In Odin, "boy" is spelled differently from "buoy."

* Leave out double quotes if the pun is spelled exactly the same.
    * In Odin, "litter" is spelled the same.

* If there is yet a third additional meaning of the word that must be clarified, then add double quotes even if the pun is spelled the same.
    * In Grasshoppers, "cheek" can refer to being cheeky and arse cheek.

* If the pun is practically an entire sentence, just put it all in quotes.
    * In Constellations, "Are Malay tapirs the dusk horse yet?"

* If words are rearranged, just wrap in double quotes as usual.
    * In Garryowen, "upturned collar" for "choler turned up."
