These are logic states that the view :
"selected" is a state that is stored. (opposite: "deselected")
"interactable" is something that can always be interacted with.
"enabled" is something that is interactable at this time. (opposite: "disabled")

These are view states that the controller doesn't care about:
"hovered" is when the mouse is over it.
"active" is when it's currently being clicked.
Note: mobile will need a third class that is the counterpart to hovered. I haven't thought it through just yet.
