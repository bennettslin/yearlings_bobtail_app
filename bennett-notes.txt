These are logic states that the view :
"selected" is a state that is stored. (opposite: "deselected")
"interactable" is something that can always be interacted with.
"enabled" is something that is interactable at this time. (opposite: "disabled")

These are view states that the controller doesn't care about:
"hovered" is when the mouse is over it.
"active" is when it's currently being clicked.

"foreground" applies to dots that are meant to be plainly visible.
"background" applies to dots that are meant to be detectable but not visible.
"present" applies to dots that are relevant to this song. (opposite: "absent")

Note: mobile will need a third class that is the counterpart to hovered. I haven't thought it through just yet.
