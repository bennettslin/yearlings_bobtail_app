# Overviews
* Include overviews in global annotations

# Correct dot categories
* Annotations have correct dots

# Audit considerations
* Annotations read naturally
    * Avoid needless words
    * Contractions
    * Use of "that"
        * Figure out a consistent rule
        * Ultimately favor sounding natural
        * Versus "whom"
* Consolidate cards
    * Fewer cards is preferable
    * Less spelling out of references in a separate card is preferable
* Make more gender inclusive
    * If the general point can be made without specifying gender, do that
    * Mention Ana and Jacob in afterwords?
        * Ask about their pronouns
