# Correct dot categories
* Annotations have correct dots

# Correct wormholes
* Wormholes all work
* Have correct destination text

# Double quotes in lyrics
* Program to add all to temporary list for audit.

# Awkward assessment
* Annotations read correctly
* Are there more?

# Things to consider
* "Mush!" is too short, dots run over
