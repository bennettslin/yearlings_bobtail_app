# Correct dot categories
* Annotations have correct dots

# Awkward assessment
* Annotations read naturally
    * Contractions
    * Use of "that"
        * Versus "whom"
* Make more gender inclusive
    * If the general point can be made without specifying gender, do that
    * Mention Ana and Jacob in afterwords?
        * Ask about their pronouns
