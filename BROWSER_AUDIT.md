# Safari audit
* No bright hover for song banner.
* Filmstrip doesn't have perforations.
* Weird bright hover for dots slide buttons.

# Edge legacy

* When access on, play button pulsate animation is weird.
* Curtain top is missing red colour.
* Curtain sides seem to only have vertical gradient, not horizontal.
* Svgs strokes are really faint.
* Play button disabled after changing song. Is only good again upon reload.

# Firefox
* Performance is terrible.

# Edge
* Colours are weird.

# Internet Explorer
* Just broken all around.
