* Try to remove extraneous tags (divs, spans, anchors) in server side
* Bennett cemetery, disposingCondom
* Abbey Road side faces
* Clarify logState labels?
* Don't make menu move.
* Audio shortcuts?
    * Make similar to Spotify.
* Tips and audio options send analytics with desktop to mobile resize?
* Take care of IP errors. (Maybe it will be fine in production?)
* Delay presence exit opacity transitions for non-opacity transitions.
* Only prolong realistic presence transitions on enter, not exit.
* Delay cubes for presence transition exit. Need to first calculate presence exit transition times.
* Don't bother with timing transitions in mobile.
* Don't stagger opacity transitions for cubes.

# Performance TODO:

# Annotation edit TODO:
* world's a naked baby, social world is just another skill
* Whimpering Oh Catherine?
* Willy sparkles?

* Establish what exactly makes for a narrative, backstory, and observation.
* Make sure backstory and narrative tenses are correct.
* Reassess what is a wiki anchor.
* Make sure no wikis repeat.
* When to use italics and quotes for foreign words.
* Change more similarlys to likewises, and other phrases.

# Things to look out for.
* Change doublespeaker set to pair in Odin.
* When to use "that."
* When to use "you" versus "one."
* When to use "help" without "to."
* "I would" into "I'd." "I'd be" works better, any others?
* When to use commas.
* When to use contractions.
