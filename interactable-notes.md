# Interactable notes

## Lyrics line

* Line can be "interactivated"
    * Only one line at a time is interactivated
        * If no line is interactivated, any can be interactivated by hover or click
        * If a line is interactivated, any other can be interactivated only by click, not hover
        * If line is interactivated by hover, it can be deinteractivated simply by removing hover
        * If line is interactivated by click, it can be deinteractivated by clicking elsewhere

    * The selected line
        * Can also be interactivated
        * Its background-colour is green when playing
        * Its background-colour is red when paused

    * When there is a verse bar
        * Selected line has no styling

    * When line is interactivated
        * Its lyric audio button is shown
        * It has an inset shadow

## Dots section dot

* Dot can be "interactivated"
    * Dot is interactivated by hover or click

* Dot is deinteractivated
    * On unhover or click
    * On clicking any blank space in dots section
    * On closing dots section
