Don't animate annotation cards in popup
Lyric expand doesn't hide dots button
Dear Saskia, dots button isn't shown upon loading with tip, when overview.
Tips Hand on ear is misaligned.
In Grasshoppers, clicking wormhole pops dots toggle in and out...
meta-referential in Grasshoppers has overlapping underline
Accessed verse makes filmstrip weird

fast forward and rewind buttons don't bounce animate, wormhole doesn't animate once annotation is selected

* Buttons are light hover by default, but bright hover as prop

* No drop shadow on annotation anchor underline

* selected verse can't hover
