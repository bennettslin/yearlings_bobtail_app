# TODO
Share configs for posters and albums.
See about sharing configs for couches and others.
Make cardboards stroke line different.

# TODO
Make filmstrip past and future colours light or dark based on paused or playing.

Can selected verse have text shadow?

Accessed or activated scene or verse should show in styling of filmstrip just like slider and lyrics.

Slider and verse should still allow hover styling in lyrics locked.

# FIXME
Make Anchor not know about activated verse index and slider moving.

Selected verse should really still show selected colouring when accessed or activated verse.



# TODO now
When lyrics are locked, there are no playing colours.

When lyrics are locked, selected verse is always text white on neutral dark background.

When lyrics are locked, selected verse upon hover does not show inset shadow, black text, or hover background.
