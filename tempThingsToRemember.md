# TODO
Share configs for posters and albums.
See about sharing configs for couches and others.
Make cardboards stroke line different.
Rethink some dot category shapes?

# TODO
Make filmstrip past and future colours light or dark based on paused or playing.

Can selected verse have text shadow?

Accessed or activated scene or verse should show in styling of filmstrip just like slider and lyrics.

Song banner should show accessed times.

Slider should show accessed times.

# FIXME
Make Anchor not know about activated verse index and slider moving.

Selected verse should really still show selected colouring when accessed or activated verse.

Don't show verse hover styling when text anchor is the one being hovered? Might not be doable.
