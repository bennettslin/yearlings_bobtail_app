# You'll fail to see the next paradigm shift

* We all understand that throughout music history
    * The pioneers who truly caused a major paradigm shift
    * In their own time, were ignored or mocked for doing things wrong
* The problem is that by the time we arrived
    * The paradigm had already shifted, and so it made perfect sense to us
        * It's the world *before* the shift that seems laughably unreasonable
    * And so we assume that the next time this happens, the test will be easy
        * At the very least, it will be easy for *us*
* And so when we see, for example, a band without a bassist
    * We smile and think to ourselves, *we* get it
    * It's those close-minded fools out there who fail the test
    * Do we actually know any close-minded fools who don't get this?
        * No, but they have to be out there
        * This is such a different way to do things
            * It fundamentally challenges our assumptions
                * About what music can sound like
                * And who might be making it
* But then we see some kid trying to create the Ulysses of rock albums
    * Biting off way more than they can chew
        * Aiming high, risking failure, and falling short
    * Where the music is so complex, it makes it really hard to get their act together on their own
        * And so they aren't getting heard on the known platforms
        * And they can't get noticed through the established channels
        * Which forces them to go even further down the wrong path
            * Each misstep begets another misstep, compounding their struggles
* And we think to ourselves, how can someone be this incompetent?
    * Everyone knows how things are done these days
        * And if you don't, a Google search will tell you
    * You get your act together
        * Build a presence on the known platforms
        * Get noticed through the established channels
        * Scavenger hunt, you've already been given the list
    * No one feels good watching an artist struggle
        * But if you're going to insist on doing everything wrong
            * It's kind of your own fault, and all we can do is shrug
* But obviously, you know where this is going
    * *This* was the actual test
        * And we just failed it
        * And in hindsight, why would we ever think the test would be easy?
    * We politely rejected Yoda's offer and kept on looking for the great Jedi master

* Footnote
    * Yes, it's a cliche
