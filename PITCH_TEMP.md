* Hi! This pitch is for labels and press who might think we're an unreasonably risky bet.

* It's easy to think of all big companies as being the same, but some begin as startups, and others as stores.

* Stores, like Walmart, profit first, then scale. If a store is profitable in one town, it proves that a store in another town can also be. Linear growth.

* Startups, like Google, need to scale first, then think about profits. They may not see a profit until they reach millions of users. Superlinear growth.

* If a startup makes no profit when it has thousands of users, why would anyone expect it can suddenly profit with a million users? One reason is the network effect, Facebook.

* Another reason is economies of scale, Amazon.

* It's easy for investors to invest in stores. But startups may not see a profit for a long time, they depend on seed money from investors. But it's precisely for this reason that they are so risky to investors.

* Compounding the problem is that unlike stores, which are the oldest business model, our world has only recently begun to understand the phenomenon of the startup. That's why the word "startup" has grown more popular in recent decades. It's a constant reminder to investors not to judge startups as if they were stores. It's a different business model.

* To mitigate risk, could investors only invest in stores, not startups? Could we expect the same innovation to come from stores? Probably not. (Mention DNA in Paul Graham's essay Startup = Growth.)

* Corollary in the world of popular music. Labels want to invest in indie artists, because indie artists promise linear growth, just like stores. Traditionally, indie artists show they can sustain themselves with a regional following. Linear growth.

* But what if some artists are more like startups, in that they need to scale before they prove sustainable? And what if certain kinds of artistic innovation are only possible from such artists? There's one quick fix. We don't have a word for these artists. I propose artups.

* How could an artup that isn't sustainable with only thousands of fans, be able to attract millions of them? Like startups, network effect. Difficult works, like Ulysses.

* Another reason is economies of scale. Complex works that require collaboration and coordination. Pet Sounds or Illinois?

* Yearling's Bobtail is both a difficult and a complex work, so it's an artup.

* Of course, betting on the Bobtail Yearlings comes with a risk, just as betting on any other startup or artup does. This is just to say it wouldn't be unreasonably risky. Good conclusion. Happy to work with you.
