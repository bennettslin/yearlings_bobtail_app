    overview: `While I can't deny that dating white women helped silence the nagging feeling I had of being racially inferior, I really didn't seek them out. A case in point is Miriam, who approached me at a party, having seen my band perform a week earlier. She was the storybook ending my ego had been waiting for: cute, hip, and drawn to me with no effort on my part. We lasted a few months. In the end, I had to wonder if she was slumming it, and whether I was just one more checkbox to mark off.`,
