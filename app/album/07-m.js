    overview: `After the breakup with Catherine, I vowed to spend the next five years shaping myself into the ideal romantic prospect. By the end, I was regularly attending local shows while cobbling together my own band. I kept running into a fellow scenester named Mara, and soon I grew infatuated. But Mara ended up going out with my drummer Jacob, which made things in the band awkward.`,
