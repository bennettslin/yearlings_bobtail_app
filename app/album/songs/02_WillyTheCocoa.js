    totalTime: 207,
    overview: `Willy the Cocoa was a mentally disabled man who wandered our streets collecting recyclables for a living. One day, some gangbangers decided to pick a fight and smashed his head open with a bottle, killing him instantly. My younger brother was diagnosed with severe autism at around this time, and in light of Willy's murder, I would lie awake in fear of what lay in my brother's future.`,
