    overview: `Hi, I'm Bennett. A long while back, I went through a messy breakup. So I decided to create a double album examining all that had led up to my life at that point, from growing up with an autistic brother to joining a mail-order cult in middle school. I then spent the next five years writing all the songs and performing all the parts for what I was sure would be hailed as a musical and literary masterpiece. Upon its release, however, the album was seen as a mere hobby project and ignored by the indie labels and press. In the years since, I've tried to figure out how to bring this hopelessly dense work to the public, given that I remain a complete unknown. I'm hoping this audio webcomic finally does the trick!`
