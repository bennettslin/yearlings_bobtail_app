        narrative: `After a long night out with friends, I might shuffle on to Sita's place, slip into bed with her, and quickly doze off. But one night Sita was waiting to confront me, having discovered my plans to break up with her while snooping around on my computer earlier. In tears, she returned the gold bracelet I had given her at the start of our relationship, then kicked me out. With nowhere to go, I wandered the streets until sunrise.`,

            `So I used doublespeaker rhyme— which I named partly for its Orwellian undertone— to depict the internal conflict between my sober self and my drunken alter ego. Since the breakup allowed me to regress in emotional age, I evoked the musical style of my childhood hero Johnny Horton, a country star who sang about the Klondike Gold Rush.`
