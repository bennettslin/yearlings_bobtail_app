        narrative: 'After a long night out with friends, I might stumble on to Sita\'s place, slip into bed with her, and quickly doze off. But one night Sita was waiting to confront me, having discovered my plans to break up with her when she snooped around on my computer earlier. In tears, she returned the gold-tone bracelet I had given her at the start of our relationship, and then kicked me out. With nowhere to go, I wandered the streets until the sun came up.',
