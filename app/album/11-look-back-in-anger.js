    overview: `With The Yearlings becoming a fixture in the local scene, I started to command more attention than I'd ever known, particularly from women. And yet, my depression didn't abate, but instead simmered into a hard-boiled anger. I also began to regret my relationship with Sita, which now felt like a decision I was coerced to make, under deprived conditions from which I'd since been freed.`,
