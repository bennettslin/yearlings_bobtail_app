        narrative: `My mood changed when I drank, leading friends to joke that I had a sinister alter ego. It wasn't far from the truth. I had soured on my relationship with Sita by this point, and being drunk provided both an escape and an excuse to act out. But I didn't like myself during such moments. I missed the hapless kid that I still was in my head, and knowing now how to get it right, I longed for a do-over, without the mess this time. And without Sita.`,

To capture the liveliness of a fiddle, I held my violin at chest level, which took some practise. The melodicas sounding in unison at the bridge were meant to evoke bagpipes at a funeral procession.`
