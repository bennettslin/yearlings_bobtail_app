I would slog through the day under a crushing blanket of despair, then crawl back into bed with dread, awaiting the cruel tricks soon to be played by my subconscious mind. I had no idea when this torment would end. The answer, I feared, was never.`,

During the years when I was trying hard to be good again, I kept digging further back into my past to figure out where things went wrong. And so this last song of the album revisits the sonic textures of all the others in reverse, starting here with the piano from "Vegan Proclamation."`,
