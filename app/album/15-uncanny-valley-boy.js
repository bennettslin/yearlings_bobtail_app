    overview: `Upon learning of my brother's autism, my parents were too harried to notice that I was being bullied at school. In guilt, they later indulged every whim I had to find myself in my own way. But as I got older, they grew concerned that I wasn't maturing as well. On top of this, they were devastated when I left Sita, whom they adored. Naturally, I felt crushed by the weight of having disappointed them. Still, I had a master plan to follow, and wasn't about to change my ways.`,
