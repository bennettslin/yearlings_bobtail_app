        narrative: `Upon learning of my brother's autism, my parents were too harried to notice that I was being bullied at school. In guilt, they later indulged every whim I had to find myself in my own way. But now I was getting older, and they were disappointed that I still hadn't matured. On top of this, they adored Sita and firmly believed me to be in the wrong to leave her. The weight of the guilt that I felt was crushing. Still, I wasn't about to change my ways.`,
