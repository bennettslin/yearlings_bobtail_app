        narrative: `Taiwan showed me how differently I would have turned out had my parents not immigrated to America. And yet, I was still worlds away from what Sasha needed me to be. Life seemed as infinitely fluid as it was immovably fixed, and I wasn't sure which terrified me more. Our house cat Odin died later that summer, just as I was exploring the idea of having faith. And yet, the eternal life promised by faith seemed no less terrifying to me than the finality of death.`,
        music: `This song uses a literary technique I invented called doublespeaker rhyme, in which two sets of lyrics that rhyme syllable for syllable are sung in harmony, one to each audio speaker, creating the musical version of a cinematic split screen. Here, I wanted to convey the despair in making binary choices whose differences are illusory, as well as the disorienting cycle between days amongst the foreign and dreams of the familiar. As such, the two voices proceed independently, each unaware of the ideas and images subtly planted along its path by the other.`
