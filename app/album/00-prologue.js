    overview: `Hi, I'm Bennett. In 2001, as I was going through a messy breakup, I decided to create a double album examining all that had led up to my life at that point, from growing up with an autistic brother to joining a mail-order cult in middle school. So I spent the next five years writing all the songs and performing all the parts for what I was sure would be hailed as a literary masterpiece. Instead, upon its release in 2006, the album was treated as a hobby project and thus ignored by the indie labels and press. I spent many years afterwards trying to figure out what would make it easier to approach, and now I've built this website with that purpose in mind.`,
