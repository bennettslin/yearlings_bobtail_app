    overview: `One night, I went along with my bassist Ana and her friends to explore the steam tunnels under UCLA while high on Robitussin. I kept getting us to pretend we were Vikings and other waves of human migration throughout history, though in hindsight, they were probably just humouring me. I wound up doing a lot of Robitussin that summer. It took me a while to regain my grip on reality.`,
