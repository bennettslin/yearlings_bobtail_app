        narrative: 'I got pretty hot-tempered when I drank, leading friends to joke that I had a sinister alter ego. It wasn\'t far from the truth. Being drunk allowed me to escape myself, and when I did, and act out in a relationship that I resented. ',

            'And so I went for an Irish reel here, though I departed from tradition by adding contrapuntal melodies. To capture the liveliness of a fiddle, I held my violin at chest level, which took some practise. The melodicas sounding in unison at the bridge were meant to evoke bagpipes at a funeral procession.'
