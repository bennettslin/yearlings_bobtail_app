        narrative: 'One night back in Los Angeles, my friends Ana, Howie, Tomer, and I got high on Robitussin and explored the steam tunnels under UCLA. I kept getting us to pretend we were Mongols and Vikings and other waves of human migration throughout history. In hindsight, they were probably just humouring me. I wound up doing a lot of Robitussin that summer, and by the end of it, I was pretty insane. I eventually regained my grip on reality, but the world always seemed different afterwards.',
