        narrative: 'At the height of my years of getting bullied at school, a strange letter arrived promising spiritual answers. With each new payment I sent, it was revealed to me that I belonged to an ancient race of extraterrestrials, with a mission to shut myself from the world. I did so by adopting my brother\'s composure, and felt a psychic bond with him as a result, even as my sanity chipped away. In time, I came to see that I was in a mail-order cult. It took me a long while to recover.',
        backstory: 'Pchelka and Mushka were dogs sent into orbit under the Soviet space program. They were killed upon reentry. In keeping with the Russian theme, the spirit of the balalaika is evoked by frenetically plucked mandolins. Since Tuva is a Russian republic, I also threw in Tuvan throat singing, where overtones in a lone voice sound like accompaniment by a second voice. I liked the implied notion that my brother is singing along with me in spirit.'
