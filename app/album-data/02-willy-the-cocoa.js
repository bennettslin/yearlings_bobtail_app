        narrative: 'Willy was an autistic man who wandered our neighbourhood collecting recyclables for his living. Kids called him "The Cocoa," referring to both his Coke bottles and his seeming a bit "cuckoo." One day, some gangbangers decided to pick a fight and smashed his head open with a bottle, killing him instantly. My younger brother was diagnosed with severe autism at around this time, and in light of Willy\'s murder, I would lie awake in fear of what lay in store for him.',
        backstory: 'In folklore of the past, changelings were trolls left in place of stolen human children, and served to explain the developmentally disabled. Sonically, I wanted to capture a band of woodland trolls in secluded revelry after such a heist, and figured it was akin to the swamp rock of Creedence Clearwater Revival, with mandolins and Cajun accordions thrown in. Lyrically, I tried to recreate my mishearings of adult conversation when my parents were first learning about autism. I spent a week telling everyone that my brother was "artistic," for example.'

But in many legends, the changeling is not a child of any sort, but in fact a fully grown troll who is perhaps centuries old.

However, Willy is also observing that my brother has yet to outgrow his "colic," a period of excessive crying in infants.

            description: '"Imprinting" is a period during which a child acquires certain behaviour, such as emotional attachment. Each time my mother learned a new concept related to early childhood development, she would blame herself for not having known it soon enough to help my brother. An "imp-runt" is also literally the weakest child in a litter of goblins, and thus a prime choice to be replaced with a human.'

            description: 'My brother learned to answer the question "how old are you?" when he was six. After he turned seven, he still insisted on answering "six." We finally got him to accept the new correct answer of "seven," but the cost in sweat and tears was so high that when he turned eight, none of us had the energy to relive the ordeal. Here, I imagine him as a grownup, testily correcting a stranger who has the nerve to ask if he is "six."'
