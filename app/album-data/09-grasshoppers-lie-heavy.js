        narrative: 'I worked my way through college as a dishwasher in a cafeteria, which is where I met Sita. After I scared her off, we didn\'t speak for several months, but she eventually reached out again, and we became friends. As I continued to suck at dating, and through my rough start in playing local shows, Sita lent her moral support, though a part of me always wanted more. At some point, she started to like me back. I\'m still not sure how.',
