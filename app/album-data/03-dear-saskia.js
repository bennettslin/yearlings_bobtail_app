        narrative: 'Sasha was a childhood friend, as well as my first crush. The strength she drew from her Jewish identity fascinated me, as I felt no cultural or religious pull of my own. But this clued me in on a cruel paradox. Namely, that nothing comes from longing to share in someone\'s faith and roots, which stay strong precisely by not being shared. Sasha moved away in middle school, just as I began dealing with bullies. That summer, I wrote her a letter on a family trip to Taiwan.',
        music: 'As a kid, I marvelled at the Beatles for weaving melodies and chords so seamlessly. This song began as an overzealous attempt to match their form and style. In the end, it suffered from overthinking, and I put it away in disgust. Years later, I realised that its overwrought nature was exactly what my letter to Sasha called for, and trotted it back out. The passive-aggressive lyrics are matched in texture by screeching woodwinds and scratch tones on violins.'
